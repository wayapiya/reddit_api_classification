Smite,Smite Focused Feedback - Toxicity,"An idea shamelessly borrowed from other great subreddits like /r/DestinyTheGame, this megathread will serve as a point of discussion around all things toxicity. It's a great opportunity to concentrate the attention of the Reddit community with regards to a big issue. 

This thread will be heavily moderated; the best comments on this thread will be **constructive,** **practical** and **on-topic.** Discussing your experiences with toxicity in Smite and ways Hirez or the community can reduce it are good places to start."
Smite,Meme Monday,"Meme away! For the next ~36 hours, memes are allowed and encouraged on /r/Smite."
Smite,I can't stand that raccoon,"Can someone please tell me why Danzaburou has increased movement speed in his forest along  with reduced incoming basic attack damage? And then he gets slow immunity and decoy leaves? Oh, and a heal on his taunt that also does damage and has zero DR? And then his one causes intoxication and drops money when it hits people. Oh! His ultimate? Why can it lock on to targets that are invisible? Why is he completely untargetable while he's riding it? This dude's kit is so bloated he could be two hunters. Am I the only person who thinks that he needs reworked?

Edit: Was wrong about increased attack speed in his forest. Also, I know that he is only CC immune while readying his rocket, but as soon as he gets in it he can no longer take damage. Which is why I said he's ""untargetable""."
Smite,New Switch player! Any guides or resources available?,"Hey! I just downloaded this game onto my Switch because I LOVE Welsh and Irish mythology and really wanted to play as Cu Chulainn. :)

That said, I’ve only ever played HotS and am generally really confused about things, especially when it comes to items and ability unlocks. Does anyone have any resources or videos / tips? This game seems awesome but I’m totally lost!

Thanks. :)"
Smite,Top 5 carries in season 8?,My friends and I are making a 5 stack and our friend is having trouble finding the perfect carry for him. What are some good ones and why are they so good? Thanks :D
Smite,Any tips on khepri?,"So i just started out recently, and i fell in love with khepri, it's a very nice god and i'd love some advice. (i only played arena thus far btw)"
Smite,The vault,I have a s5 key from the Hel skin I bought. Is there a time limit on using it? Also do the skins in the vault change because I don't play any of the gods for the s5 vault?
Smite,Terrible luck in assault?,"Does anyone else get awful luck in assault?

Over the past week, I've had 18 losses and 5 wins :(

Terrible team comps on my side, really CC heavy teams on the enemy, and just all around awful luck.

It blows my mind how some people have extremely high win rates."
Smite,Ward challice need a new price/rework,"tl;dr Make the challice cost 200 and hold 1 ward at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the thing. I ward probably on average around 12-13 times per game. At 400 this would save me money and is good value. The problem? You just can't afford to buy it too early in the game because you will get slaughtered for putting yourself behind in terms of build. Especially when the meta is super snowbally and causing everyone to build early pressure gods. Although, on that note, when I see my teams wards at the end of the game it typically hangs around 5-8 per person. I don't know if I ward too much or they don't ward enough. Either way, the challice isn't good enough for anyone. If you build challice later in the game then you just lose value on it which means you probably won't be making good in terms of value. Taking this into account, you can also see that we get a free ward in our second relic spot. Yes the ward is shit overall but it still wards for a period. Buying challice makes this irrelevant, or you could argue challice is irrelevant because of the free ward.

I have though about a few ways to change this and I think this is the most fair way to fix it. Make it cost 200 but only holds 1 ward at a time instead of 2. You can buy a second ward if you want another. This way you can always use the free ward in your relic space as your second as well."
Smite,"Wards = Legal Wall hacks, so why don’t we use them?","So I was showing my friend (a gamer but never MOBAs) Smite and this dawned on me through one of his first interactions watching the game.

A typical early game jungle skirmish unfolds, a little 2v2 poke fight, we disengage and reposition, each team hiding behind jungle terrain. I drop a ward over the side of a jungle wall and it sets up my Ra’s beam for good dmg, we get a kill.

My buddy, who is watching Smite for the first time, goes “woah wtf was that?” 

I think ok he’s an FPS gamer so I tell him  “oh, yea some abilities go through walls”

He says “no dude the wall hacks how did you do that”

And it occurs to me...wards are fucking OP! Tracking enemy movement like this in any other game would be considered literally game-breaking!

I explain wards to him and this is the funniest part, he goes “wow how do people feel about that? That seems so OP, do people not think that’s broken? It seems like it would take the fun out of it and games would just boil down to warding battles?”

And I’m just laughing because I have to reply with “Nah actually, most people can’t even be bothered to buy them!”

It’s really a fascinating phenomenon."

I've been doing this for 4 years now but I'm kinda getting a little too busy and overwhelmed to keep this up so hopefully someone else can pick it up for me? Thank you all for your continued creativity and passion for the gods of Smite whether you're an artist or simply enjoy seeing potential skins for your favorite gods!"
Smite,Solo's,So I'm going to be doing ranked for the first time in after the split. And my main solo guy is chu culainn. Is there any other good solo gods out there? I tired erlang but quickly found out I find better use for him in jungle
Smite,Team flamed me for playing Serqet Support in a casuals,"I joined a conquest game today only to get shafted to support. I usually don’t play support and am a jungle main, so when I get the role, I like to play the most viable assassin supports, such as Fenrir, or Serqet, who is maybe not as relevant in the current meta, but Serqet support is absolutely a thing that can be done, especially since it was a casual and not a ranked game.

Well I choose Serqet support and my teammates start flaming me in the lobby telling me that Serqet support isn’t a thing and basically screaming at me. I told them to just relax and that it’s a casual - and then our carry locks in Cerberus. This is where I should have put 2 and 2 together, but I simply thought he was memeing because it was, ya know, a casual.

Anyways, we get into the match, I pick my support start, and I go to purple. The Cerberus also goes there. Then my team suddenly tells me that I AM ADC NOW. And this Cerb is my support. After I already got support as my fucking role and picked up support starter items. So now I had to rework my entire fucking build and go carry items to try to somehow make something out of this terrible situation and my teammates who don’t understand that you can play supports that aren’t guardians. At the end of the game, we obviously lost, but I ended up going 4/7/5, which I think is pretty decent for playing a Serqet ADC and opening with a support start.

I’m just so pissed that my teammates had so little knowledge of off-class picks and forced me to play a role that I did not select. And even if it was a bad pick, it’s CASUALS. Let people meme and try weird stuff, if you want to sweat play ranked. I don’t even know what the point of this was I just wanted to rant. Uuuuuggggghhhhh"
Smite,Most viable hunters in mid,"IMO the most viable hunters for mid are: chernobog, izanami, cupid and medusa.

Your opinions?

Since i keep hearing people being so divided in this subject."
Smite,Any Polynesian god ideas?,"I've been playing a lot of Pele recently and I just realized she's the only Polynesian god in the game. While there's Cthulhu and Baron as well as the new addition Tiamat who all have their own catagory I was talking with my friends about what kind of gods they could add to be with Pele. I personally know nothing about Polynesian mythology or any of that. My first thought was Maui from Moana and idek if that's accurate.

So basically if anyone has any cool ideas and/or Polynesian mythology stories please tell me. :)"
Smite,does gifting a skin from the gifting tab give you a skin as well?,"i've noticed when i gift people emotes I get an emote as well. or it looks like that's what happens at least, if you do that with the skins chest do you get a skin from it as well as the gift receiver?"

Long Range Assasin Example= Tsukuyomi"
Smite,I need help getting better,"I have been playing SMITE on Xbox since around season 2. For a long time I had trouble playing anything besides support due to my inability to stay alive during team fights. I have kept at the game and maintain a decent K/D/A to this point, I have gotten better with more gods and have expanded out of the support role in most game types. I want to get better at Conquest and start trying my hand at tanked but I feel too inconsistent sometimes. What do you guys recommend to do in terms of “getting better” I feel like my weaknesses lie in counter-building and knowledge of the knew Conquest map. Thanks in advance for the advice!"
Smite,[GAME ISSUE] Has anyone experienced this? I think imma get banned eventually lol,"I'm beyond frustrated. I've been experiencing this issue since last patch - yeah, the same one that kicked everyone out of their matches and effd up everyone's elo after the update - I get randomly kicked out of the game and I cannot rejoin the match. I queue, I get into match lobby, everything is fine, I see the loading screen with god cards and all that and suddenly I'm kicked into menu screen, and I can queue for a new match. Yet, apparently, I'm DC'd from the last match.  I restart the game, I see the loading screen into the match with all the god cards and stuff, and I'm kicked to the main screen again. No matter what I do, I cannot join the match that I was kicked out of.

Two days ago I got my first penalty for 30 mins. Yesterday I queued, this happened again, received 40 mins. Now it happened to me \*again\*, I got 700 mins Not to mention, I'm definitely collecting reports for DC/AFK. I checked in with my ISP, I even tracked how my internet connection is acting, nothing wrong with my connection, not a single hiccup. My PC is also fine. Literally not an issue on my end. This is something that has been happening to my friend, too. This is a problem on Hirez's end, I'm pretty sure of that.

Submitted a ticket to support, I got the useless ""our technicians are looking into it"" answer that is pretty much support's diplomatic way of saying ""lmfao get rekt skrub"".

Three questions:

1. Has this happened to anyone else?
2. How many of these can I rack up before I get an outright ban?
3. Why is it so difficult for Hirez to keep this game functional?"
Smite,Looking for other streamers to play with!,My husband plays Smite every night except Wednesdays from 8pm to 2am CST. We'd love to have other streamers join in on the fun! His Twitch name is Quadthulhu. :) Drops are enabled.
Smite,Cernunnos opinions.,"I really like the character and I love playing him since I’ve just came back to him after a while. But he seems sooooo weak compared to other hunters, I just want opinions on how you feel about him."
Smite,CC that work on argus?,"as a title,argus is full cc immune or some cc works on that big boy? because i’m not sure but i guess is it possible root him"
Smite,Osiris eye of the jungle solo build: before or after the laning phase?,"I've been trying a cheesey protections build with Osiris that involves upgraded Eye of the jungle to make him a menace in team fights.

Another one I've been trying is pretty well known, warding sigil upgrade+oni's+spirit robe and just being unkillable but that one is more geared towards magical teams. 

Anyways, laning phase with eye of the jungle sucks balls against most Warriors, so should I just insta buy breastplate, then after laning phase buy the upgraded Eye?"
Smite,Anhur reskin/updated model?,"Just wanted to know what other people thought, seeing Sobek just got his reskin and updated model I really think Anhur getting one too would be nice seeing how much he is used in casual and competitive play!"
Smite,Need more cdr for horus support,"My build is sentinel's embrace, guantlet of thebes, winged blade, caduceus shield, stone of gaia, &amp; mantle of discord."
Smite,Is there a point building CCR on tyr with his passive?,Noob help me
Smite,Ranked joust information please,I’ve been playing ranked joust with my 2 teammates recently and we’ve been doing pretty good. But I know we could do better. What’s in the meta for picks and bans and team comps and such? Any information will help. We are low to mid gold right now and I know we can get platinum easily. Just need a little help from my fellow smiters.
Smite,How do you counter Cab solo,In my opinion Cab is probably the most toxic solo. How do you effectively counter him? Is there a good god matchup? Or maybe certain items? Obviously ancile and runic but idk what else.
Smite,What is the current adc crit build,"So since the crit nerf I have shifted away from building crit on hunters but today I came up against a lots of teams without a tank and I have been trying to build crit against them I've tried a variety of different builds 

I had the most success with this build. Hunters cowl, Ninjas tabi , Gauntlet, Execution, Rage , Wind demon and sell boots for Failnot ( I think it is 75 percent crit with stacked rage ) 

What would you change for this build and what is the optimal crit build rn"
Smite,New to smite,I saw someone playing and they said you can get RWBY skins on you gods is that correct or was that a limited time thing that I missed
Smite,KA level order outside Conquest,"As the title states, what is King Arthur's optimal leveling order for modes outside of Conquest? Say Clash or Arena. Mostly the first ability to max, his 1 or his 3?"
Smite,Glass cannon characters,Which characters can be considered as one or glass cannon is something more like build related?
Smite,I've downloaded every god skins of the game and sorted them by themes,"I'm almost done. Out of 1281 skins i have around 130 skins yet to be sorted / can't be sorted because they're alone in their theme ! I mostly did that because we wanted to to thematic team when we use a skin boosters with my friends, now we have an very easy way to know every gods with a corresponding theme ! :D

I don't know yet how i could display my work to you guys. I could either do a huge drive with folders, or maybe a huge graphic but i will have to split it in multiple parts because there's way too much skins.

Counting battlepass (that i haven't merged with an already existing theme) but excluding recolor/tier2/mastery skins, i have 96 differents themes with at the very least 2 skins in them !

[Here's how it looks so far](https://i.ibb.co/0fvBZ04/smiteskins.png)

How do you guys think i should display them ? Separate graphic showing multiples themes, depending on their length ?"
Smite,When you reach Level 20 you are not invincible,"I guess you could call this blog more of a warning based off of my last heartbreaking defeat because of sheer ignorance and refusal to adapt. But I also feel this is something a lot of players don't seem to understand.

I was playing, one of the best, rarest games on Smite you can play, a genuinely even playing field. I've seen this phenomenon...maybe 4 times in my 4 months of playing Smite (every other game is a stomp match). But, as the game went on it was clear that my team was the better one individually.

The game went on past 30 minutes and everyone on both sides was Level 20.

Then as we played I noticed that our sizable 10 kill lead and 10K gold was shrinking. And then I realized what had happened. The enemy team had all bunched up together and were ganging up on us. I told everyone this, and they ignored me. And I watched as they would run off, demand to attack the Titan and ignore the fact 3 of our team still had 50+ seconds of their respawn timer. By the time they died new members would run off and everybody threw the game. I tried to play defensively I tried to assist my team hoping they would finally listen. I tried to get picks and win team fights, hoping I could stagger them in similar ways and we could mount an assault. All the while practically begging them to stay behind and wait and play defensively. But no no, ""Attack the Titan!""

In the end we lost because our ADC and ~~Carry~~ Mid decided the Middle Phoenix was far more important than protecting our Titan, and our Jungler and Mid were still respawning, which left me in a 1V3.

I don't like to blame my team and say it's all their fault. But in situations like this I know I wasn't to blame which only leaves me more frustrated that my team essentially threw the game by refusing to adapt to any situation."
Smite,What gods to ban in rank modes?? (All),Coming back to smite so advices would help
Smite,Is an Animosity build good for Amaterasu in arena?,"I recently got wrecked by a Chaac who had built Animosity and the frost hammer that slows on basic attack, among other things. I was wondering if something similar is possible to pull off on Amaterasu. I was able to get her to 3.7K health with my build. That comes to 148 extra damage per hit with Animosity. But this was with a pure health build that had no anti-heal or protections so that's not optimal at all. I was wondering if anyone could give me a good build that incorporates Animosity. And if Animosity isn't the way to go, I hope you can tell me what I should be building."
Smite,aphrodite with this new update,its chaotic how weak aphro is currently like she use to be decent/good before this update and previous versions of the game...now shes just weak asf...in mid shes sooo weak..she has 2 damage abilities that do sub par damage...a 1 sec stun...and a 1 sec immunity ult....compared to other mages shes soo useless and if people play her in support its also useless because the heals (with either damage based support or tanky support) do little to none capping at maybe 50 heals per tic for like 4 sec at max level...shes just pretty...useless currently..ofc she can do good im game at times but overall she’s pretty pointless..
Smite,More Gods like Rat,"I think Hi-Rez should add more gods like Rat. He’s the only god that has an item with multiple branches that affect his abilities and play style which is awesome. Adding more gods with unique shifting play styles would be awesome. While it does make him unique I think it’s kind of a shame they haven’t implemented more stuff like him.

Edit - Achilles is a good example to with a his passive making him more damage or tank based. But I’d like to see more items unique to gods that alter abilities and play style."
Smite,Question regarding Duel MMR,"Just a quick question regardian the MMR in Duel: 
Does anyone of you know exactly when someone reaches grandmaster? It's stated in the description that the top 50 Masters will reach Grandmaster, is this still the case? I currently have 2978 MMR and am ranked in Masters. I really have no clue when I will get to Grandmasters, since there are fewer than approx. 30 Person above my MMR. Also - I am somehow not displayed in the ranking with my MMR, how is that?

Thanks in advance!"
Smite,"""Stop playing ranked""","
Telling someone to stop playing ranked has a much more negative effect on the matchmaking than than those ""noobs"" who should ""stop playing ranked"".

You are pushing players away from the game mode, not even the best matchmaking system can put together good matches if only 30 people play. 

Stop telling people to stop playing ranked if you want good matches. The ""bad matchmaking"" you are complaining about is a result of YOUR actions. 

It's actually funny how the same people who discourage others from playing ranked are the same people who say ""dead game"" and go pika face when they see the same players over and over in their matches and complain about matchmaking. 

Use your brains. Understand the consequences of your actions."
Smite,Why does subsequent hits of Heartseeker get halved but Qin’s Sais is allowed to get its maximum proc every hit?,The Qin’s Sais proc does even more damage than Heartseeker because it starts at 3% max health damage and scales to 5% while Heartseeker starts at 2%. Either Qin’s should get the same treatment as Heartseeker or the health threshold for a maximum Qin’s proc needs to be increased by a lot. I’m talking like from 2750 to 3100 or maybe even more. Gods like Ymir and Athena don’t have to build a single health item and are nearly taking the maximum qins proc. And now there are more health items than ever making Qins one of the strongest items in the game if not the strongest outside of starter item upgrades.
Smite,Unable to find matches ?, I get this message **“The system was not able to find a match for you this round. You are the highest priority for the next round.”** every god damn time
Smite,Playing against Ares,"I'm very tired of playing against Ares. His passive seems to be the strongest in that game to my knowledge. He makes an average tank or bruiser build and gets up to 180 power for free? How do you even begin to fight him if he hits all his chains on the same target? I find that even playing an ADC, and building %pen he still outdamages me."
Smite,Game won't open,"When I load the game I get the loading screen as normal. Then my screen goes black (as usual) after that it goes straight back to my dashboard, the game itself fully loads, I see it at the bottom task bar but when I click it the screen goes black and green I hear the music then it goes back to my dash board. I've been searching for a solution but nothing seems to work.. What's more is today with I powered my pc the icon for smite is earth? I uninstalled today and reinstalled to no joy so wondered if there was any help here?

I can record a video if it may help more?"
Smite,Proc item effects on Set,"Can you tell me what some good items to proc on set are, and how the interactions work? Can his individual spawns proc effects, as well as ticks from his 3, + explosions from Kingslayer? Im brand new to the God, but he seems like he could be a proc'ing monster."
Smite,Does this game have any characters that are mainly support oriented?,"Hello! Coming from games like overwatch and paladins, I thought it'd be interesting to expand my horizon into MOBAs. League of Legends seems a bit daunting, so my other main option is this game. Are there any Gods who have a focus on healing or buffing others? As my username suggests, that's a big preference of mine. Thanks in advance!"
Smite,Personal Request,"Stop wasting a ban slot on Persephone

 thanks"
Smite,Unplayable lag ps4,It's been going on since last night. I shut the game off and on and it's still present. What should I do?
Smite,-50mmr and -30tp for a teammate leaving at 9 mins. Nice ranking system.,Maybe if it was joust I would understand but really in conquest you punish the entire team that much for one person leaving? It’s pretty impossible to win a 4v5 and you’re going to make sure the entire team gets punished for someone leaving not even 10 minutes into the game. How is that fair?
Smite,Can you someone help me grasp a better understanding of what a warriors job is?,"I’m a newish player, only been playing for a couple weeks, and I just don’t really know what the job of a warrior is or what they even are. I heard that they are a mix and an assassin and guardian but I don’t really know tbh. I’ve played as a warrior before and did ok but I just didn’t know if I was playing it right. I’d really appreciate if someone could help me out"
Smite,"Hey, I have a question about penetration %",So I know the cap is 40 but for item with passive such as the executioner and wind demon give you pen with each attack does that count toward the 40% and can it go over 40%?
Smite,Give me your arena Serqet gimmicks,"So since I'm seeing an uptick of Arena Serqets as a direct fault of Anime, and I personally just really love to play Serqet, was wondering what players have been finding as their best case scenarios and any strength or gimmick to exploit since the most recent itemization shift. I have been doing a ton of testing and not really been all that satisfied with any build or role. My general hypothesis is any given build is a gimmick in Arena, but I just want to be the best gimmick I can be for everyone's scorpion aunt.

Here is my current analysis: (feel free to TLDR and just tell me why I'm wrong)

Overview

Serqet's Main Strengths:

*  Mobility, Long Distance Kill Secure Runner
* Good Single Target(ish) Crowd Control
* Decent Single Target Damage vs Squishies
* Positive Energy

Serqet's Main Weaknesses: 

* Terrible item scaling
* No innate protection/tankiness, conditional or otherwise
* Really hard to connect with a full ability rotation in arena conditions.

In general, I don't know if there's something Serqet can really do in Arena that 5 others can't do better. I would compare her most closely to Bastet, maybe, but Bastet has much more reliable and better burst and you have a bit longer range mobility. You have the full antiheal on your 4, which is nice, but the jankiness of the hitbox means you can't always reliably hit your intended target and hitting someone who has beads up often means you've sacrificed yourself entirely for no benefit.

Builds and Rationale:

Critqet - Crit Damage Assassin

The pubstomp favorite. The build I mostly see other players use is some combo like: Bluestone. Warrior Tabi, Deathbringer/Rage/Malice, Jotun, Bloodforge/Heartseeker. If a single CC hits you, you're probably going to die no matter what the damage build, so I guess might as well maximize what you do in one rotation, right? If you're lucky, your team will be providing enough distraction that you only mostly die from splash damge and you might be able to leap out in time if the rare arena Awilix isn't on the other team. You can 1v1 if you get ahead and the enemy lets you and they're an early game hunter or a mage who you managed to catch alone with their pants down.

&amp;#x200B;

Coolqet - Ability Bruiser Serqet

Rush Jotunn's for the cooldown and maybe a second damage item to maximize your early game damage and then tank up and polish off your CDR so you can be an ult bot and hope someone else on your team can pick up the damage once your lvl 13 spike starts to dwindle. You'll still do a little bit of damage and maybe people won't be so mad at you for \***securing\*** their kills if your CC is up to save their hides more often and you don't feed as much. Honestly I'm otherwise more of a tank player and still find myself wanting to thrown on a Mantle of Discord even if I go crit, so this feels the most comfortable to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Tankqet - Full Support Build Serqet

Your last three teammates dialed in as assassins when the timer hit 5 and you were taking just the biggest sip of water, so why not be the tank? I find this works better if you think of yourself more as a traditional guardian than a warrior. With full defense/supportive items you still aren't as tanky as the real tanks and you won't even compare to the amount of constant damage they put out since your cooldowns are so long, but you can soak up all the ults and CC and peace out if your team is doing fine on damage. Your 2 is a pretty good peel and ability interrupter. You could also just play Artio, but maybe you want the thrill of leaping from halfway across the map and locking down a squishy who was five steps out of line for four seconds and watching your team hit get distracted by a Cabrakan while you shamefully walk back towards them. 

Other: 

Full ability damage: Your ability scaling is absolute garbage into the late game but you can try to maximize pen and CDR. At least they're easier to hit than your auto attacks.

AA warrior: You're jealous of all the tank Ao Kuang, Da Ji, and Loki players running around the arena laughing and executing the backline with wild abandon and want to live like they live. You don't have any innate protection or sustain, constant base damage, abilities which help you stick to a target, CC immunity, or even the +5 base speed most warriors get. Your kit is kind of specifically designed to do this badly, but hey.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Tell me what is working out best for you with Serqet in Arena?"
Smite,You guys need to improve your anticheat,"Had a match where a dude was speedhacking around the map pulling people into turrets. Seems unfair, took video.

Smite,Does the additional 10% pen from auto-attacks on Dominance affect Kaldr’s Auto?,"Fairly self explanatory, Dominance gives 10% pen and an additional 10% on auto attacks. Would love to know if someone has tested this on Kaldr (*I mean Skadi*) and what their findings were regarding Kaldr’s “auto attacks”.

Thanks!"

Smite,Rant Megathread,"Hi all!

This is the second iteration of our bi-weekly rant megathread, where our 'no rants/soapboxing' rule is suspended!

ALL CAPS IS ENCOURAGED! RANT AWAY!
YOU MIGHT WANT TO RANT ABOUT HOW THIS POST IS ALMOST 24 HOURS LATE, BECAUSE I'M A MORON."
Smite,Nox is doodoo,"I love Nox, I love her design, I love her overarching theme, I love her lore.

But even as a Nox main with 6 stars, she is doodoo compared to other mages. I know she's supposed to be a niche, single target focused but she's a very all-or-nothing kinda god.

She literally has no poke. She needs two abilities to secure damage. If she misses, she's useless for 6-8 seconds in a teamfight. Is she misses twice in a teamfight, the fight is prolly over by then and she has done nothing but silence (annoying but nothing comparable to other mage AoE abilties).

Missing out on a combo as a mage is such a detriment to your team. Like, have you ever played joust with a nox who misses 75% of the time? Feels like a 2v3 sometimes when playing with her.

I just, idk. I really wish she is one of the gods this year that get a tweak/rework."

Smite,Nintendo Switch Asia server,I would just like to know how is the playerbase for smite asia server on Nintendo switch? Because i remember playing it on xbox a year ago and I was having a hard time finding matches
Smite,Genuine question: Why doesn't this game have any good build resources?,"I feel like a lot of the toxicity in this game comes from people expecting competency from the playerbase, but there really aren't any easily accessed resources for how you're supposed to build your gods. Smitefire is considered a joke by the community, Smiteguru relies entirely on user made guides that have no way of verifying their actual efficacy and [don't even get me started on Smitesource.](https://imgur.com/An44MxO)

League has amazing guides that are updated constantly like u.gg, Mobafire and even companion apps that run while you're in the game like Blitz. I know Smite is a smaller game, but I feel like a huge portion of the community's frustration with it's own skill level is largely to due with the difficulty in actually learning the game.

I'm sure there's plenty of youtubers and streamers people want to jump and recommend to give build guides, but that's part of the problem too. If you expect players to scour the internet for obscure content creators and watch hours of streams to find out what the best builds are, then you directly cause that lack of available information that creates the skill gap that's so frustrating. This type of information has to be easily accessible or else a tiny fraction of the playerbase will bother accessing it.

Obviously these types of sites exist for League because there's a lot more money to be made, and so for Smite it would be much more difficult. I wonder though, what if we as a community took the crowd funding approach to it? I'd absolutely pay for an aspiring API developer's patreon if they were to create an aggregate build calculator like u.gg has for league, taking data from matches and creating builds based on each role. How would you guys feel about pooling funding to make something like that a reality?

Smite's apparently doing better than it ever has in terms of player numbers if Hirez is to be believed, and with how invested the devs are in this community I think the community I think there's a lot of potential for third party resources that are easy to use and improve."
Smite,"New FPS/freezing issue, only with SMITE, can't find a solution. Maybe related to audio?","So this issue is probably somewhere on my end, but I can't figure out why it's happening, and the issues are only with SMITE. 

Within the past week, I've started to get severe FPS drops/long freezes when certain abilities are used in game. 

I'm at a steady 150 FPS, then Ah Puch ults and my screen is just frozen for the entire duration. My theory is that it is related to the audio that plays during the ult, since there's plenty of abilities that are way more VFX intensive that haven't been triggering this problem.

Ah Puch ult is the worst offender but not the only one. Certain abilities like Raijin 1 cause a smaller/shorter version of the same lag issue. Some games I don't experience it at all so it definitely is tied to certain gods and their SFX and/or VFX.

I have tried;

- Restarting PC (obviously)
- Updating and reinstalling graphics drivers (twice)
- Updating my audio drivers
- Reinstalling SMITE (twice)
- Adjusting all my settings, including playing on nearly minimum on everything

None of it has fixed this issue. The annoying thing is the inconsistency—I can go one game with no issues and the next I'm freezing every 20 seconds for 5 seconds at a time.

Since I am only having issues with SMITE and no other games, so I wanted to see if anyone else has encountered this specific issue and found what the root of the problem was. 

Very well could just be something randomly breaking with my PC but it's weird I'm only seeing problems with SMITE then. I know this isn't a subreddit for random PC issues which is why I'm hoping someone else has encountered this SMITE-specific issue too and found a solution.

If it helps my GPU is a GTX 980."
Smite,bastet penta and 30-4 game!,"I had a game where someone tried to troll (geb was mad I beat him in a previous game) and played geb middle. I pulled out a win with a 30-4 score

Smite,What if we had a magical defense Lotus Crown???,"It could be similar, not the same for the sanctity of it not being a copy and paste type of item. Something that healers could use to boost their teammates magic defense with their healing abilities!!!
Maybe call it bubble bracer???"
Smite,I'm so glad they nerfed healing this season.,"Aphro and other healing characters are too strong. Even with several anti heal items, the constant healing does almost nothing. I just finished a game where I had tainted breastplate, brawlers and pesti as solo. My other teammates had atleast 1 anti heal item. The other team was Aphro, Sol, Hercules, Raijin and Nemesis. 

They just kept out healing everything. I don't understand what to do, we all had anti heal items. Either increase the % decrease of healing reduction in the items or decrease healing. Nobody should dive structures at any given time while all anti heal items are available and on. This truly is not fun, not to mention teammates yelling at eachother for ""not doing enough anti heal"".

 Mathematically more then 1 person can have 100% anti heal but that doesn't stop the healing? I'm not good at math but this truly is not adding up."
Smite,Skin concept - Cthulhu,"Death Poinsettia - Cthulhu   
Passive: The tenticals turn into flowers and redish spell effects with petals come off the affected player  
Ability 1: A flower (cthulhu head) bursts poisonous gas that deals damage  
Ability 2: A flower in the sky droppes seeds from the sky into a field of flowers.  
Ability 3: Creates a field of flowers on each side of cthulhu   
ULT: Cthulhu's bottom half is a flower holding his top half in it. and around him is a feild of flowers. sever is a wave of flowers, DEVISTATE shoots a seed that explodes into red effects, and transfuse makes the flower holding cthulhu drop seeds dealing damage."
Smite,Anyone else often end up with way more assists than kills when playing Heimdallr?,I've been grinding up Heimdallr to ten Mastery and I swear I get more assists then my support way more often than with other hunters. Anyone else have this happen to them?
Smite,"Does Jorm need a buff, and if you think yes, how would you buff him? [DISCUSSION]","Jorm seems to be kinda lacking this season, I’ve watched some top players discuss him and his potential issues, and I wanted to maybe discuss what he could use to make him stand out a bit more. 

First off, his passive is annoying with how the designed it. You could take away the 10% additional damage AND the slow and it would change very little, his team fight mid to late would still be bad if he didn’t farm ahead. So right away bare minimum I’d take away the 10% additional damage taken. He doesn’t have an escape besides his ult and if he uses his ult to escape it’s awful for team fights. So that leaves him with no escape AND an uncanellable slow, having a tank take such a huge amount of additional damage is just silly, 

Second, his kit revolves around his venom pools and multiplying them with his abilities. Problem is besides tick damage they don’t do much. They have a small slow which can be stacked with Isolation, which is nice, but besides that all they accomplish is empowering his Consuming Bellow. And EVEN THEN to do close to decent damage he has to use all 3 of his abilities to do some damage and a brief tremble. It also leaves him without any form of escaping, once again, without his ult. So he either goes all in and dies or escapes and contributes nothing. 

What I’d change here is maybe allow his 3 to spawn 1 pool always for possibly improved ganks, so you can 3, 1 and then 2, adding a few more options for how you approach a fight. Maybe even add a brief poison effect for some smaller damage ticks after leaving it, while also making things like Divine Ruin a bit more effective. You could also perhaps add to his breath IF he absorbs from bare minimum 3 pools, giving it additional damage and maybe a slow while being hit by his breath. 

His 3 is okay I guess, it allows him to be kinda stealthy and it knocks up. I’d still like it to produce one pool. 

As for his ult, maybe make the pools from it bigger? And maybe do more damage? It’s him becoming massive but the pools stay the same size, it’s kinda weird imo. A small change but with items like Divine and Iso that could maybe be a good enough change. 

Anyway these are just ideas off the top of my head, and I’d love to hear what you guys think and what’d you want to change about him. He is super cool so I want him to at least be better, but not broken."
Smite,I hate playing my favorite class.,"I really enjoy guardians, but I have significantly more success with other classes.

For example I fucking love Athena.

She doesnt do all that much damage with her kit, but the poking and aggressive behavior I can get away with is so much fun. Hitting an out of position Danza with my stun and watching him get stun locked by my team is amazing, but her Ult is even better. Lots of my friends play assassins and one game on Joust he was playing Loki. Whenever I would recall I would wait with my Ult in fountain. And that Discordia that was getting a little farm while no one was around suddenly erased. He went 22 - 2 that game.

But a lot of my old Smite friends dont play anymore. I use xbox group posts, but Smite doesnt have a big enough player base to guarantee Ill get a squad. Game Chat isnt an option to communicate with friends so I get games like my last one.

Casual Joust: I got an Ah Puch, Cernunnos, and I played Xing Tian. We were against A Poseidon, Chaac, and Thanatos. It wasnt a very good matchup, but it could work. Anytime one of them tried getting in close I would hit my root and burn. They would run and my team might follow up. A good early game, but I was very aware that If wasnt able to save them they would die in every fight. That was fine until Chaac and Thanatos got their ults. Chaac silenced me with his ult and prevented me from using Shell and Thanatos could kill him target before the stun ended. The turning point in the game was when we were taking the Phoenix and Thanatos tried to flank around speed camp. I saw it and hit my root and burn when he came around the corner. Ah Puch saw me fighting, but didnt help (Presumably because he didnt have any abilities up) Thanatos walks up to the Cernunnos who had tunnelvision of the Phoenix and he died. Ah Puch and I tried to retreat, but we were both low health and thanatos ulted on me. With no one to protect him in the middle of the lane Ah Puch died.

 

I cant play guardian with randoms because I cant trust my randoms to be good.

Hi Rez, Please allow voice chat in casual games. If I could have told that Cernunnos about the Thanatos we could have won."
Smite,deleted my progress on my xbox account,"Hi everyone, I want to erase all traces of smite on my xbox account to connect my pc account anyone can help me"
Smite,Can Kali's heal be changed somehow?,"Like make it half as shield for 10s or something? Her early game is the worst of any jungler to pay off for her ""strong late"" but she'd shut down hard by the enemy team just peeling her until her ults down.

Obviously that's just kali right, she either gets her kill and keeps on going or doesn't and dies. But with the abundance of antiheal options at the moment she is also now hard countered by just stacking up some antiheal - she literally will not heal from getting her kill.

Which again, I get counterplay is good it makes her manageable but having two pretty hard counters to her playstyle and the trend of every god these days having so much mobility, self-peel and/or healing confirming her kill is hard enough as it is against a competent team her late game isn't anywhere near the powerhouse it has been and due to all of this yet her early is just as terrible as it always has been.

Perhaps just give her some more base mana or something to give her early game a small boost therefore taking some of the need for her late game to be so impactful?

Maybe I'm just not adapting well enough or need to move my build around, been messing about with some but I find the need to build magis on her most games, hastened, antiheal and starter doesn't leave a lot of room to play around with.  


  
Edit: Gonna try out a few games ability damage, apparently thats her thing these days"

Smite,CROSS PROGRESSION,I am trying to transfer to pc soon but all my skins (around $300) was spent on ps4 do we have any news how soon cross progression for ps4 will be out?
Smite,Tiamat's Serpents and Tyrannical Plate Helm,"I'm trying to figure out whether any part of Tyrannical Plate Helm's ability works with Tiamat's Serpents. Helm says ""Ally lane minions"", and Tiamat's ""Summon Serpents"" ability says the Serpents ""act like minions, traveling down lanes and attacking enemies"". This leads me to believe they should be treated like Lane Minions.

The 20% health buff from Helm obviously can't apply, because the Serpents have hit points instead of health.

In Training, it doesn't seem like the 20% attack speed buff applies. When I move more than 70 units away, the Serpents seem to attack at the same speed.

In Training, when I use Tiamat's Consume to kill the Serpents, it doesn't seem to give me the stack of 5 power. It didn't give me the stack when I had an enemy not kill the Serpents either.

I was honestly hoping these would all work, because it would add another playstyle option for Tiamat players. Even the Hardened Scales don't do enough to enable a tanky playstyle. It kinda seems like, even with all of those abilities, she's pretty much limited to being a caster.

Anybody find any different results with her when using this item?"
Smite,Camazotz solo,"How would you all build cams solo this season

Smite,Is it worth coming back to Smite?,"Hey everyone, I started playing Smite in early 2014 but stopped playing at around early 2016 because I started getting into League. Right now I'm not playing League either (I didn't quit, I just wanted to take a break and use that time to play a bunch of games I have on Steam) and I was wondering what state Smite is in right now. I'd like you guys to tell me about it, but from the times I've played it every now and then as well as some videos I've watched:

\-God releases, for the most part, tend to be far more conservative than League's champ releases (so usually simpler kits). While I guess this does make balance easier, it is one of the reasons I moved to League since none of the god releases I've seen in Smite (I've kept track of them all even if I wasn't playing) seemed interesting to me, aside from Horus, who I like quite a bit. Overall, I like League kits better, though I like some Guardians and Warriors here (namely Horus, Sobek, Bellona, Athena, Sun Wukong, Sylvanus and Khepri).

\-Cosmetics are more hit-or-miss than in League IMO. There's a bunch of really awkward skins in Smite, with cringy VPs and pretty meh ability effects. There are definitely a few skins I like tho. I don't like Smite's whole deal with chests being everywhere, and I'm not sure about the Battle Passes .I remember I was an active member of the subreddit when the first chest-exclusive skins were released and I was one of the people who was like ""nah don't worry Hi-Rez won't take it any further"". A few years have passed and well... over 3/4 of Smite's skins are chest exclusive, or something like that. Smite's skins seem to, at least on average, be better than League's skins when it comes to clarity, although I've never really had any issues with that.

\-Conquest is... interesting, but isn't it like reaaally snowbally? Granted, I lost whatever experience I had with Smite since I haven't played for so long, but it feels like coming back is nigh impossible in the few Conquest games I've played. Towers seem like they are made of tissue paper and fall super easily (although due to overall lower damage towerdives are harder than in League), and teamfights seem very, very one-sided. This point is what probably will influence whether I want to come back or not the most, since I'm not really interested in playing other gamemodes anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

If I started playing again, I would main support, so my questions about the role would be: Are Sobek, Sylvanus, Athena and Khepri viable? Is Horus a good support? Should I roam as a support? I ask this last question because, back when I played, supports seemed to roam way less than they do in League.

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it. Thanks for reading!"
Smite,Which Assassins can work in Solo?,"I’ve heard Camazotz and Fenrir works okay, and Set does really good.

What about the others? I’ve seen some videos about Ratatoskr or even Thanatos in Solo, do they actually work?"
Smite,Custom GOD BUILDER slots,"ok i have this puzzle/question in my mind... am i the only one who wants/needs more slots on gods builder? why u should have only 4 slots available for each ""section"" rather than 6 like it shows in-game? for a few gods ok i might not even fill them all but for others i want to add more situational items ""shortcuts"". i can add some more items on ""relics slots section"" and thats it. the ""consumable section"" is not even showing in-game so i could use that too. is it so hard to add 2 more slots on custom builder? this is so annoying"
Smite,Didn't receive ranked skins,"Hi all,  
My buddy has been complaining for years, He's a Guan Yu main and he just never received his Ranked Gladiator skin and keeps talking about it. He's submitted a few tickets over the years and has never gotten a response. Is there any way for me to help him with this?"
Smite,Janus needs a nerf,Plays let’s talk about it. Janus is extremely mobile and have high burst damage. Which is unfair. Unlike other mages there’s no catching him. He’s beyond safe. All his abilities are on a extremely short cool down. He was funny before ppl jus sucked ass with him but now he’s broken. Never seen a mage that literally use one regular ability and takes half your health. This god has 3 different escapes with insane damage. There needs to be some kind of punishment. This god gets away with too much
Smite,My skins are all gone,Well most are. I don't know why it happened but when i was last playing like in 2018 i had all my skins and life was good until my ps4 broke. Anyway fast forward to now i got a new ps4 and decided to download smite and when i logged in i saw the mystic Artemis skin that i was playing with right before it broke so i know i owned it. So i got to check my skins and see them and i notice i don't own it and i think thats weird so i check my other gods and i lost literally most and when i mean most i mean i have like 15 skins left when i had near 100 or 200. So i don't know if its that i couldn't transfer data and thats why im missing skins but i don't know what to do.

It feels like such a slog that 300 experience I get at the end of a match barely moves my XP bar. Is there a mode that gives more XP or is it literally I just have to play a million more games praying people have XP boosters since I used all of mine"
Smite,My 8 year old Smite video has gone mini viral!,"To give some context I was invited to the Smite beta on PC in mid-2012. I and some friends started streaming and making corny youtube videos.

It seems that in 2021 youtube decided that one of these videos was worthy of being recommended. I have gotten so many comments on how nostalgic the video has been for viewers and it's been great connecting with other former and current players. This has brought me back to Smite for now and I have been streaming a bit of it. I hadn't played Smite since Baron Samedi was released until just recently.

So I thought you all here might be interested in seeing it if you aren't one of those who had it recommended to you!

Smite,Is this game any good on Switch?,"I’m super into MOBAs (I’m a Dota and League player), and this game seems to be a really fun blend of action and strategy. The only console I have is a switch though, and I have an old old PC so I can’t play it on that. Are the controls and stuff good on Switch?

And if someone could link a good beginner’s guide to this game that’d be great too,

Thanks!!"
Smite,Angels and Demons,"Yes ladies and gentlemen, you're not hallucinating! I'm talking about angels and demons in Smite, and I'm not arguing with or correcting anyone (At the time of posting, at least)!

This coming Tuesday I'll be posting my first member of the Occult Pantheon. Why is this so important I'm making a post about it? I'm glad you asked.

It's no secret around here that many Smite players want to play as popular demons and angels. But that's always been an issue because angels and demons are usually associated with the Abrahamic religions, that TitanForge has directly stated they will not be adding. *But*, in responses to other posts I have suggested an effective solution to that problem, which some of you agreed would work. That is; the Occult pantheon.

Many of the angels and demons that community members have expressed a desire for are not actually tied to an Abrahamic religion. At least not in the form of a demon or angel that has been popularized by media. They were designed by offshoot groups, or ""Cults"", or just written of by individuals believing themselves to be of a mystical or enlightened nature.

Thus, under the umbrella of an Occult Pantheon, these creations (which some would argue are just as ""mythological"" as Agni or Zeus) can be added to the game with no references or ties to any Abrahamic religions, with no risk of offending any members of those religions who bother to read.

Through public awareness and community additions to this pantheon, and the support of the community, we can show TitanForge that this is a way they can give players what they want, and probably even draw in new players. And although my first addition to the Occult Pantheon will not be an angel or demon, such additions will inevitably follow at some point. Other concept makers are of course welcome to make characters for the Occult Pantheon, providing of course that they actually fit there.

Thank you, and good day.

Thank you, and good night."
Smite,UK returning player,"Hi all, 

I'm wondering if there are any discords/groups for players around the GMT timezone who would be willing to help someone relearn the game.

Smite,Magical Hybrid Items aren't Very Good,"Playing magical solos just arent very good rn, and part of that is the items you build. Most of the time the only hybrid items you build as a magical solo are void stone or lotus crown if you have healing. the helm tree is awful, the stats on the items are bad and the passives arent worth it, fal is getting changed thankfully, but i also think that tree is underwhelming. Ethereal staff is good, but gem of iso is just a inferior frostbound and warlocks is just a stat stick that you have to stack, and asclepius is only good if you have healing just like lotus crown. Alot of the items listed above don't fit into builds most of the time because you have to build other things like cdr or antiheal, which makes you build stuff like breastplate or an antiheal item. Physicals have the shield tree, which all of those items are really good, ancile and caduceus are also good, sledge is still good after the nerf and frostbound which got buffed start of season 8. Physicals can typically get good amount of cdr, ccr, prots, power and antiheal, without sacrificing much and having items with better passives like glad or ancile."

Smite,PS4 Cross progression,"Hey everyone, I’m trying to play smite on pc and have linked my PS4 account (where I have all my progress) to the same hi Rex account that my steam is linked to.

I can’t seem to access my account and after searching around I saw a couple older threads complaining about how there’s no cross-progression for PS4. Since I couldn’t find any recent threads about it I was wondering if it’s now a thing or if I have to start again."

So, in general, is it stable enough and consistent enough that this is generally viable? Or is it enough of a concern that I’d be better off just keeping it to the Ethernet?

Thanks!"

Smite,Does Crit really add to the game?,"So here we are after the most recent bonus balance, and crit got hit hard. Fail-not has 10% base crit, and spectral got buffed big-time.

That's one less crit option with 20% or more now. 

Remember when Ne Zha and Artemis passives had crit on them? Well Titan reworked them to become less ""random"" because of a random crit at only 10% crit chance. 

Then they reworked the shurikens and daggers so only the T3 variants would have crit for the exact same reason. But now so many items give so little crit that it's almost the same thing...

In order to reach 50% crit, it takes multiple items to reach it, and even then that's just a coin-flip.

So here, I ask: does crit even belong in the game? If it's either too strong or too weak, should we do away with it altogether and create a different stat?"
Smite,DARK SOULS Battle pass?!?!,"I've been pondering potential battle pass collabs and I started thinking about Dark Souls and thought it'd be perfect. Some ideas:

Kingseeker Frampt as Jormangundr (probably the best idea that's ever come out of my head)

Knight Lautrec as Loki

Big Hat Logan as Merlin

Lord Gwyn as King Arthur

Executioner Smough as Chaac (maybe his ult could be his butt slam) 

The Chosen Undead as Mulan (adorned in the elite Knight set, I thought this one made sense with the versatility of weapons used in Mulan's kit)

Ceaseless Discharge as Cthulhu

That's all I could really think of, I'd love to see more ideas in the comments, i.e. Solaire of Astora, Knight Artorias, Ornstein the Dragonslayer, etc

EDIT: So after a few minutes of posting I realized the majority of these people don't talk, so maybe this isn't the spectacular idea that I thought it was. I'd still like to see ideas, so I'll leave the post up"

Between my friend and I, have 2,000 hours in the game. Searching their name on SmiteGuru shows they have about 1h 5min total in the game. They bought random items that they didn't finish, attacked no one, and ran in. They clearly didn't understand the basic mechanics of the game. It just seems crazy to put them in a match with us and other long time players.

Smite,Groovy Aphrodite when?,So let's be honest this game milks the goddess appeal cash cow pretty thoroughly. I just got a girlfriend who happens to be black and I would really appreciate if my only options weren't Yemoja and Nox. And if we're being real groovy aphrodite isn't that great either.
Smite,So .. about Zeus.,"Man, each time i play this god i feel sad for the People like the god itself.  
Each day i play him, i feel like he is not even half the god he could be.  
Sure he has damage, sure some consider him op on which i have to disagree strongly, since i look at conquest here, but he never really feels like the lightning-spear chugging god that zeus is always depicted as.  
Look, in pretty much all media as well as mythology, Zeus was always someone who was a great Leader even tho he had major flaws as a person.  
He was often seen Leading his group from the backline, chugging powerful spears at his foes that could decimate enemies and while his 3 has a slight hint of that, the whole rest feels majorly lackluster. If i was to neglect this point and rather look at his balance state, it does not look much better, sure people make him work, tho that comes at a very risky cost with a payoff, that would be much bigger on other gods with the same weaknesses and strenghts as Zeus.  


One simple example is Anubis, who while yes he is very immobile and does not have the overall aoe size of our Zeus, he has MUCH better damage that is also just as, if not easier and more reliable to apply. Sure he does not have a huge ultimate but let us be honest, most of us barely get hit by more than 2 of those strikes in his ultimate unless we missplayed badly.   


I do love the god, but to be honest, i personally play Zeus soley for the idea that he is Zeus and not cause his gameplay is amazing nore practical in a way.  
I would really like to know, if anybody would be interested for a rework of said god, since we can not buff him without breaking it for the new players, nore can we really touch him considering on how HiRez seems to have a total dislike for giving him any change.  


I mean damn, he is our Posterboy guys :("
Smite,How do you play Sol on PS?,"I unlocked Sol for free!

Also any reccs for a build for her is also appreciated :)"
Smite,Replacement for bumbas hammer on Set after nerf?,"I’ve been playing a lot of Set solo lately and usually skip a starter to go into bumbas hammer late game, but with the upcoming nerf it doesn’t sound as viable as it has been. What do you think a good replacement would be? Skip a starter and go a heart seeker or something similar? Or possibly go protector of the jungle since it will probably still be a great item?"
Smite,Skipping a starter item to build a finished one late is becoming a meta strategy in the midlane,"Just posting this here to spread the word as most people I see are still building conduit gem.

Basically since conduit/archmage gem has been nerfed, high elo midlaners are starting to forgo a starter item altogether to get a finished one from another tree later at level 20. [Venenu has uploaded a guide on midlane builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA2y3dhb5bY&amp;t=974s) that explains this strat in more detail. And its not just him, a lot of people are starting to move over to this build strategy.

So first of all, why is this happening, what's wrong with **conduit gem**?

* So conduit gem is still decent in the early levels, but the passive falls off by midgame
* **Archmage gem** is still okay, but its been nerfed a bit and sometimes the passive is just wasted on clearing minions while sieging.
* **Gem of focus** is only really useful on low cooldown spammy mages like Chang'e, Hebo and Tiamat, and Bumba's hammer is usually just better on them if you can proc the resets.
* Forgoing a starter item lets you get the big mage power spikes like rod of tahuti and spear of desolation (the core items for all mages this season) a lot faster even if you may lose wave push on wave 1.

And of course **sands of time**, and **vamp shroud** are both kinda meh as starter items given that you can just get CDR and/or a bit of lifesteal through the boots and spear of deso (and maybe soul gem if your god utilizes it well),

So then what are mages building instead if they are skipping a starter item? The dominant choices include:

1. **Sundering Axe**: the default choice right now that any mage can build any game and feel good about. The overpowered passive helps you shred tanks, and the defensive stats help you stay alive.
2. **Sentinel's Embrace**: if your support didn't get this or doesn't backline (as I don't think two of them stack), then this item can be really good as its the best defense item in the game and it helps you peel for your backline. I've tried this myself in games where I'm getting owned by dive and our support is diving with war flag and it makes you and your ADC so much harder to kill that you can easily peel for eachother when dove.
3. **Bumba's Hammer**: Really broken on low cooldown mages like He Bo and Chang'e (heal spam FTW), and probably Hel as well. Also may be worth using on autocancel gods like Morrigan or Scylla even as a more stat-overloaded replacement for polynomicon which is hard to fit into builds right now without giving up % pen.
4. **Tainted Breastplate**: Basically a better divine ruin with some hybrid stats if you really need antiheal but want to get spear of deso instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway just posting this here for a general discussion. I thought the build path was weird at first since it does make your early game way worse since you start with less pots and less wave clear, but as soon as you get boots and T2 tahuti it doesn't feel that bad at all. And I remember the T2 boots T1 doom orb start from season 6 so that's helping me play around the awkwardness of this start to get a stronger total build in the late game."

Smite,Build per Mode,"Suggestions:     On each god you can use the builder to make your own build, but maybe it is already possible but I didn't find it, but I'd like the possibility to get the opportunity to build multiple tab for every game mode or just for some fun game, etc."

Yes, she's really good late game, but if you want damage there are so many better options. If you want minions you have Any Wa or even Kuzenbo. If you want tank bruiser you're better off with many guardians. 

I really like her and play her because it's fun late game to just be everywhere messing up all the enemy plans and unexpectedly being able to kill.... But I always feel like I could have done better with any other god. I think some small ability edits are really in order.

Do you play her? Why? Or if not, what's went with her?"

Just really typical, she sounds like she's depressed lol, anyway love the skin!"
Smite,Quality of life update I’d like to see,"Not necessarily for conquest unless you have a pre made team and want I have fun, this is more for casual players. 

1: The ability to search god’s by pantheon during the god select screen. 

This is mostly for when you have a quest but not sure who you wanna play, or you did know who you were gonna play but the god got selected/banned. Or you have too many of a role/class, say you’re playing arena and you have 3 Hunters because reasons. Now you have to pick something else. This maybe doesn’t need to be implemented but it could be good for new players or in experienced players. 

2: Searching gods in the “gods” section of the Home Screen/ god selection (maybe) by passive or ability. 

What I mean is, you wanna do a build idea, but don’t know who off the top of your head who would benefit from it. Example, you wanna do a full bow/attack speed build, now I know Apollo will benefit, but I can’t remember who else off hand, (Artemis, sure) I could search under sections like “passive&gt; attack speed” it could show gods who have an attack speed focused passive, selecting the god could show a recommended item list, then maybe build a build based on that. This could help new players/ inexperienced who don’t know some gods abilities or passives, even understand how to counter. Might also help players when they get buffed/nerfed, could help remember what God’s do what. 
Another example, “gold benefit passive” aside from fafnir and maybe Danzaburou I don’t know who else has a gold based passive or ability. This could help when learning a god, or could help you find a main, or even understand certain gods. I don’t remember all the gods who do Tick Damage, a section for that could help me remember. There are 113 gods as of now, I’m level 123, been playing since season 4, you think I remember everything about them. This QOL I’d like more. 

If anyone else wants to build on these ideas go ahead, anyone else have other QOL suggestions let me know."

Obviously late game you tend to have quite high mana meaning the item packs a big power boost most of the time.

Smite,Error 10022 Possible fix for Smite and other games.,"TL:DR and fix at bottom!
Hey everyone, the past few days i've been having an issue where any game running with EAc (Easy anti cheat) will not run or launch. It will open up to an error, most often error 10022. I haven't really been able to find any solutions online until last night.

The short and simple to it is that EAC updated, but did not overwrite it's security certificates, causing a mismatch and not allowing any games using EAc (smite, Fortnite, Apex Legends to run.)

The fix is simple
1. Find where your game is installed
2. Open up the EAC folder in that game directory
3. Find the certificates folder
4. Delete the certificates folder
5. Verify the integrity of your game (or your launchers equivalent)
6. Play!

TL:DR EAC updated, but fudged it's security certs. Delete the certs folder in your game directory, verify integrity, done."

Smite,PS4: Has Your Safe Frame Setting Disappeared?,"I was watching my partner play on her PS4 and her safe frame was set to the minimum(as in the HUD was shrunk down and there was a whole bunch of empty space around it on the screen). It’s definitely wasn’t always like that and not an option she would have messed with on her own. When I went into settings to try to fix it, the safe frame setting itself was just missing. It’s still there where it has always been on my Xbox. 

Have other PS4 people had the setting default to minimum and the slider for it just disappear from the video settings tab? Hopefully some of you kind people can check your PS4 and see if this is true for you too."
Smite,Shouldn’t Vulcan be a Warrior or Guardian?,"Given the surplus of Mages and the shortage of Warriors, wouldn’t Vulcan fit better as a Warrior?

There’s already at least two other Roman Mages in Discordia &amp; Janus, so I don’t think the transition would be difficult, plus he already looks kind of tanky. If it’s been discussed before please disregard."

Smite,Tips and Other Stuff you Probably Didn’t Know about Tiamat!,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve been playing a bunch of Tiamat recently(almost at my second star), and I’ve found a bunch of weird and sometimes helpful stuff about her which can help you out in Tiamat games! 

About her 1: 
-Consume (1 in grounded stance) will not trigger item passive effects if the only thing it does is execute minions/jungle monsters. This means if you execute a wave of minions while you have soul gem, it won’t make a stack. Likewise, you won’t get sacrificial shroud to proc but more importantly, conduit gem WILL NOT consume the stacks. This effectively means you don’t need to waste a few seconds of cg stacks to get that last minion and you can save the clear for next wave. 

-Consume (1 in grounded stance) can eat buffs (duh) but you can refresh an eaten buff timer with ANOTHER eaten buff. Ex. If you steal an enemy blue buff by execution, you can refresh that timer by also eating your blue buff. If you try to pick up yours by normal means or someone else kills it, you can’t refresh the timer. 

-Primordial onslaught (1 in flying stance) can be canceled (duh) but most don’t know there is about 0.3 seconds of downtime after you finish charging before she auto fires, hit the button again to launch them earlier. 

About her 2: 
-Tiamat’s 2 in grounded stance sometimes just doesn’t knock up(but does damage) don’t know why but it occurs most often when someone is walking perpendicular quickly towards your ability. 

-Like Chang’e’s animations it’s slightly faster for Tiamat to ground stance to 1 and then 2 than the other way around 

About her 3: 
-Okay so her 3 in grounded stance can be bodyblocked and interrupted at any point in the dash, if you get interrupted at any point past the .05 second mark of hitting the input, you *will* successfully go into flight stance, but probably not in the spot you want. 

-Tiamat’s 3 in flying stance is exceptionally glitchy. You can be mid flight and get cc’d and just glitch back to your flying stance wherever you were. This most notably happens with Chacc ult, but it is so much worse than other leaps.

About her 4 and passive: 
-Tiamat has the single best passive in the entire game, not just at base but because of her kits interaction with it. 
Spawning her serpent minions and having them die gives Tiamat her ‘large’ heal from her passive. One use of serpents has up to a possible 1200 healing! Having a bunch of serpents stacked before a team fight is very useful for randomly getting health while fighting, likewise you can preemptively spawn minions and switch into ground stance to periodically get DR stacks while you brawl. 

-Managing her serpents to amp her passive is a very important part of her kit that isn’t easy to learn. 

-Spawn serpents when you leave base in other lanes. 
Yes, this does give you a small amount of extra exp. You are Tiamat—probably one of the worst early game characters in the game, but one of the strongest if not *the* strongest late game. Get yourself leveled up. 

-Her ultimate in ground stance isn’t too quirky but remember it gives about a second of CC immunity when casting, which is useful for the obvious (begone ares ult) but is also fantastic for chasing because it cleanses slows that people often place behind them when running. Yesterday I just immune’d an entire Skadi ice blocking my path to her and got the kill. 

Play style and items: 
-You can play Tiamat in the middle lane and solo lane successfully. Jungle is meh because her early game is abysmal. 

-Conduit gem is nice because it mitigates her bad early game clear. Additionally, Gem of Focus is MY go-to for upgraded starters, it is incredibly good on her. 

-IMO Soul Gem is the single best item on Tiamat in either role. Stats are great for her, but she can proc the passive (or get stacks) on 7 different abilities in her kit. Getting max Soul Gem stacks and releasing an extra deadly tornado is good, but the sustain the item gives is better than anything else possible to pick.

-Chronos Pendant isn’t troll on her. A lot of my middle games I go chronos pendant first item with lifesteal boots, soul gem, spear of deso. 

-Don’t be afraid to get defense on her, even if it’s one piece. Defense gets reduced before her DR which means it’s super efficient, if someone is giving you extra trouble, get some d.

-Stone of binding is an excellent transition item for her at any point in the game. 

-I wanted to make vampiric shroud work, but because her executes don’t give procs it isn’t worth it all the time, but please don’t get sacrificial shroud, you will die. 

-if in solo, still get damage (or at least soul gem) because your base values are not enough late game



Thank you for reading and I hope you got something useful out of it!"
Smite,Chaac needs help,"I haven’t been on this Reddit for a long time so sorry if there’s a smite Reddit specifically for balance now...

Anyway. Chaac has been pretty bad for a while. Super fun character in my eyes, but mostly just cuz he isn’t meta and those characters always feel the most fun to play. 

I have one simple solution that I think would actually help chaac a TON. And another simple solution that would be good too.

1) make chaacs AA damage chain 1x/.75x/1.5x or something like that. It’s currently .5 for the middle one and it’s painful in terms of damage. So often your second auto does JUST under the damage you need to kill a creep and I think anyone that plays chaac a lot will recognize this 

1a) for those concerned, you can keep his AA speed the same and just increase dmg. Idk how many characters are like this now but old ravana (one of the most fun kits in the game) had a .5x/.5x/1x speed chain where the middle hit did .75x dmg, so it actually was better than it “should” have been. So it’s not unheard of in smite.

2) smaller change, more of a QOL. Make his 3 go on cd right away. I tried chaac with Bumba’s hammer and tbh I had a blast. But it’s so awkward with the rain going on cd when the rain stops, not when it’s used. It’s not something that really matters other than this scenario, and you could lengthen the cd to match. Overall this would be a slight buff but not by a ton.

3) proposed idea that idk if he needs: passive tweak. Make it mana dependent. If above 50% mana, your passive makes your ability cost no mana and lowers cd by 2 seconds and 1 second on other 2 abilities. If below 50% mana, your next ability gives you half the mana it would’ve cost to cast without your passive. I didn’t put much thought into this but I think he could easily be given a cool passive 

I’ve played a lotta chaac the past week or 2 and would just like to feel like I’m not trolling when picking him. For anyone curious, the build I’ve been enjoying is:

Boots rush, shifters, ancile, cad shield, pridwin, Bumba’s hammer (in whatever order makes sense). Can sell boots for whatever. I know with blue buff and red pot you overcap cdr to like 90% but idc. It’s fun and if you replace items it just doesn’t feel as good. Only thing I like replacing is getting a warriors axe to start but Bumba’s is too fun to not go that. And also he’s one of the few characters where even tho red stone is really not great, it’s fun on him :)


What do you guys think? I’d like to see chaac just a little more competitive and anyone who plays him knows how weak that second AA is."
Smite,"To my fellow teammates, from jungle","Dear team,

Can we get something clear, jungle is a hard enough role to play as it is and there are certain things I cannot do for you. 

I can’t gank someone 5 levels ahead of me when they’re on full health. I can’t gank the duo lane at the same time as I’m ganking solo. If I choose a slightly out of meta pick, it’s fine if I’m decent with that character, I don’t need you to f6 at 10 purely because of my pick. If I’m behind, I need to farm in the jungle, I can’t gank if I’m behind. I could do without “you rock”, “cancel that” every time something goes slightly wrong, it dissuades me from visiting your lane. Finally, quite a lot of the time, when you die, it’s probably not my fault, when I get an opportunity I’ll help but not when they instakill me when I step into the lane.

I hope you guys are understanding of this.

Thanks,
Jungler"
Smite,New to Smite from Dota. Help!,"Hey everyone. I played Smite way back in 2016, and then moved to Dota. I still play Dota regularly, but decided to download Smite anyway. 

Consider me as someone who's absolutely new to this game. What gods would you recommend? 

For reference, in Dota I am a midlaner/carry and my absolute favorite hero is Monkey King. SWK in this game isn't too similar to dota MK. Other heroes I play are Mars, Sand King, and Visage. What gods would be good for me, and what roles? 

Any guides on item choices etc?"
Smite,'Fears' regarding linking steam account to Nintendo Switch,"Hi,

I want to link my 'Smite Steam account' (I started in the normal launcher, before Smite dropped its launcher and started use only steam), to my nintendo switch but I did a search around here and I read that some people might have lost skins ? 

Some progress wasn't in synch ? Is that true ? Or they fixed that ? I would like to link my account but I'm scared  of lose skins and progression in the game.

Thanks"
Smite,Short idea for an Izanami rework,"So, let me begin by saying this is absolutely just for fun, a little thought experiment if you will. I am not a game designer and it’s possible this idea could be completely terrible or super overpowered. I’m also not going to include specific numbers for anything here, as I don’t think I’d be the best with those specifics - this is purely conceptual. That being said, feel free to provide feedback in the comments or ideas for what you’d like to see in an Izanami rework.

My basic design idea for this was to change parts of her kit to better fit part of her original concept: an ambusher that could use her dash to sneak up on enemies and deal massive damage. I also wanted to fix many of the issues that make parts of her kit feel extremely weak or underwhelming. Izanami is a top pick for new players but is seen as absolutely trash in higher level play, so I wanted to bridge that divide as well and make her more balanced all-around while not completely getting rid of the key aspects that Izanami players love her for. 

1 - Sickle Storm

Activating this ability toggles between 2 stances Izanami uses for her auto attacks.

Normal stance - Her autos function as they do currently, piercing through enemies and returning to her for a portion of their initial damage. Additionally, Izanami’s auto attacks deal bonus damage towards minions and jungle monsters while in this stance. 

Spectral Stance - Izanami summons 2 ethereal sickles that fly vertically and uses these for her auto attacks. These phantom sickles do not pierce enemies or return to her. Additionally, Izanami’s auto attacks gain bonus physical penetration against enemy gods while in this stance. 

Upgrading this ability increases the bonus damage or penetration of each stance respectively. 

2 - Spectral Projection

Izanami summons a ring of ghostly visages from the underworld, which charge inward to frighten enemies.

Izanami targets a circular area at a distance, and on the edges of this circle summons 8 ghostly visages, each facing towards the center of the area. These visages fly inward, applying a movement and attack speed slow to enemies before disappearing upon meeting in the center of the circle. Enemies in the center of the area as the ghosts collapse inward are afflicted with fear.

Upgrading this ability reduces its cooldown and increases the power of the slow. 

3 - Fade Away

As is, except for a few buffs:

Damage-over-time effects no longer reveal Izanami while stealthing.

The first auto attack Izanami fires while in stealth is now empowered, dealing an additional flat percentage of an enemy God’s health on a hit.

Upgrading this ability now also increases the percent health dealt of her first auto.

4 - Dark Portal

No changes, aside from perhaps a minor increase in damage.

Passive - Hunt the Fearful

When Izanami has not dealt damage within the last 5 seconds and hits an enemy, she gains a temporary bonus to attack and movement speed."

Smite,Are friend referral rewards bugging?,"Hello everyone. So the point is that I'm trying to get the Tyr skin from the refer-a-friend system rewards.

I wanted the Tyr skin too, so I just made a smurf account, referred myself and actually I could get the level up bonuses up to his 15. I made another too (because you need 3 friends to reach lv 15 for the skin), but from the last patch I didn't get any reward for lv up, neither my second smurf acc. So anyone knows what happened there? I just want the Tyr skin so bad. It seems referral rewards don't work anymore. :(("

Smite,In lobby reporting,"League has it. 
So smite needs to add it.

Can't tell you how many times I have had people being toxic in a draft lobby because someone didn't like their role or someone's pick. Alot of times it continues into the game or they whine so much someone does a favor and leaves the lobby.

Even if someone doesn't want to waste their time with that guy I still am unable to report that toxic guy from the draft lobby. The wrong person is being penalized. I have no problem with the deserter it is the guy that threw a fit to make them leave.

I would like to see this added in the future."

Like fighting 2v1. I get there to help them retreat, shell to avoid most heavy damage, then they just turn around and charge in and die. Then comes the ""Ok"", ""Good Game"".

I've mostly played ADC Hachiman and a few games Persephone/Kuku Mid. Before i took on this conquest adventure i played a lot of Full Crit Rat, Crit Attack Speed Serqet and some Kali and King Arthur.  


I honestly think i can get a hold of the solo lane Arthur gameplay after a few matches. The other three are mostly played on Jungle but playing Jungler is scary haha. I've watched a few guides but they all talked about high level gameplay.   


\-What are some jungle guides you would recommend/or even guides in general since i have a lot of room to grow??   


\-I love playing a large variety of characters and roles in all the games i play, Is that possible in conquest or should i stick to one role and 1/2 characters??

Smite,Update Download Speed,"Howdy, there have been other posts about this a few years ago but it seems this problem still exists.

I have 50 megabits on the down at the moment and haven't played Smite in a few months.

First problem is to update, the downloader forces you to download every update in sequence rather than just the most recent major update and patch.

Second problem and why I'm posting, is that eventually you get a 14GB download after downloading several gigs of previous updates, and then it stalls out about 25% of the way through and puts you on something like 4 megabits for the rest of the download.

So basically, the downloader is broken where I'm at, and for what it's doing. I'm in Aussieland and I'm guessing it's trying to peer-to-peer me or HiRez are being really conservative with their Australian CDN costs and limiting bandwidth.

Compared to other services, this is really shit. Steam CDN and Akamai want to eat all of my download cap when I want a game. HiRez apparently wants me to wait for 3 hours to download something which should take 20 minutes or less at my max download.

Why do you hate your gamers, HiRez?

Ed:  Someone actually \*downvoted\* this, nice. "
Smite,Attack Speed Zeus actually seems pretty good this season,"This isn't a new thing. Zeus was pretty good at boxing with his old kit, and lots of people meme'd attack speed builds on him in previous seasons. That being said, I think it has real potential in this season, mainly because of item changes that make him kinda nasty. 

&amp;#x200B;

The premise of auto attack Zeus is that his autos apply charges, and each charge increases your auto attack damage by 30%. This stacks three times. You actually do optimal damage while auto attacking people at three charges until they're in kill range with detonate charge. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the item changes, you can actually go Death's Toll-&gt;Death's Temper. With this item, you gain 3.5% auto attack damage per stack, stacking up to 10 times for another 35% auto attack damage. The damage you can do is pretty great. This also stacks on minions/monsters, so you can also stack it somewhat before fights. It procing mid fight automatically starts snowballing your damage quickly, as a kill/assist grants you half of your stacks.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've been doing for testing has been going Bancroft's-&gt;Shoes of the Magi-&gt;Hastened Ring-&gt;Demonic grip-&gt;Ring of Hecate-&gt;sell shoes for elixir-&gt;Telkhines ring. I buy Death's Temper whenever I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this build, I sit at a comfy 2.42 attack speed. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put the damage in perspective, I went into jungle practice and bullied Neith bot. 

&amp;#x200B;

The damage at first went (Damage in parenthesis comes from Telkhines ring)-

The Telkhines damage is scaling upward because of the power steal from Hecate.

&amp;#x200B;

111 (60)-&gt;158 (65)-&gt;211 (70)-&gt;**272 (72)**

&amp;#x200B;

The bold being the final value that you get on every auto. This isn't that strong, but take into account that these autos come out at 2.42 attack speed, and you can press Detonate Charge for an instant 582. It makes it fairly strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that is a base. If we look at numbers as Death's Temper begins to stack, the damage numbers rack up to be pretty interesting. With 5 stacks of Death's Temper, the amount you get from one kill/assist, the damage values go-

&amp;#x200B;

151 (60)-&gt;204 (65)-&gt;259 (70) -&gt;**319 (72)**

&amp;#x200B;

The damage with only one kill/assist is already pretty decent, but if we go and we get a second, the damage becomes-

&amp;#x200B;

173 (60)-&gt;234 (65)-&gt;311 (70) -&gt;**384 (72)**

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually pretty good damage. At base you're hitting for 233 damage, and it scales up to 300-&gt;380-&gt;450. The thing that makes it really neat is that his detonate charge still hits for 580 on three charges. His bolt still strikes for 400/bounce. Lightning storm still hits for +450/tick. He still has insane ability damage, and his ultimate is still an incredible zone control skill. 

&amp;#x200B;

The build is fairly flexible, still being decent with only a couple attack speed items. I tend to flex into divine ruin or toxic blade if I'm in the mood to be cursed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Death's Toll helps a lot with early mana sustain. You don't rely as much on abilities to apply bolts late game, which is very nice. The main issues I've had are that you don't have a ""get out of jail free"" card like Chronos, Freya, and Sol. You require much better positioning, the build takes a bit to come online (Freya does as well, to be fair), and you need to have a team willing/able to protect you.

&amp;#x200B;

TBH, it's probably not a super strong build, but it's REALLY fuckin' fun to use. Nobody expects attack speed zeus to absolutely shred everything."

Smite,Theory: Morgan Le Fay was the one who summoned Jormungandr to Camelot in the first place,"When Arthur and Merlin were first introduced into the game, their event lore also came, and when reading it those years ago, there was something off. (Actually a few things.) Morgan was nowhere to be mentioned, and in Smite's lore, Mordred isn't actually her son, as in the actual mythology, but rather Guinevere. However, there was something that caught my attention when I reread it. As Arthur describes in the first chapter, the invading Saxons were always being beaten by Arthur and his knights and so,

&gt;*...the hordes turned to darkness, to ancient secrets and forbidden places that they could neither control nor understand. It was by their hand that the greatest evil imaginable was awakened, but as I contemplate it I wonder, is it they who are to blame, or is it I?*

Originally, it seemed that it was the Saxons who had first summoned Jormungandr, as they are worshipers of the Norse gods, as they call on Thor and other Aesir in their fights to win, and almost causes Arthur to kill Thor on the spot when they first meet.

&gt;*“The Saxon God of Thunder,” Arthur said, his voice low and sharp with bitterness. “The name I have heard upon the lips of the barbarous hordes who butcher my people and raze their villages. The name their warbands whoop in celebration as they carry the children of Camelot away into slavery. Stand aside, Hera, honour demands a reckoning, here and now.”*

However, it would make sense that these mortals would go looking for other sources of power to help aid them in conquering Camelot, as it seems that the Norse gods weren't really helping them all that much. This would lead to them seeking out Jormungandr to help them. However, trying to summon a literal harbinger of the end is pretty tricky, and seeing as the mortals of the Smite world don't really use magic (if they did, they would probably be able to defend themselves more).

That's where Morgan comes in.

She is stated to be a powerful sorceress, and in Arthurian mythology, she is often trying to destroy Arthur and Camelot through schemes and plots, some direct, some elaborate. As well as that, she is stated to live in Avalon (which in the Smite world is basically outside of Camelot).

With this information, this is how the theoretical timeline of events goes.

1. Arthur and the other knights successfully stop the Saxons time and time again, and at this point, most of them don't want to keep trying to conquer Camelot
2. However, like Arthur, who learned about the Saxons and their ways of life, they do so too, and remember that Arthur has a certain foe, that being the enchantress Morgan Le Fay
3. They seek her out from wherever she is in Avalon, and she agrees to help, as she wants to bring down Arthur
4. She teaches them how to use magic, specifically Norse magic since Jormungandr is a Norse being, and shows them the rite as to how to do it.
5. She sits back and watches in content as they go and summon him, leading to the near annihilation of Camelot, but Merlin saves the day by using that same magic to banish Jorm back to Avalon

There is something else as well. In the Smite lore, Mordred helps Arthur rebuild Camelot by defending the main area while Arthur and Merlin go around and restore order. However, it's revealed that Mordred has turned evil, and is killing everyone because Jorm is going to inevitably return and that, in his words,

&gt;*We are presented then with a choice, are we not father? Shall we enter oblivion on our own terms, or those of a monster?”*

At first, it seems like Mordred has come to this decision by himself. However, in Arthurian legend, Morgan is his mother, and she is the one who feeds his ambition to usurp Arthur, and makes him her puppet. Then, it would make sense that, while Arthur was away, she saw another opportunity to break Arthur by turning his own son against him, as a way to stay true to the actual mythology behind this pantheon.

(To add to my theory timeline)

6. Dissatisfied, Morgan watches Arthur and Camelot keenly, searching for a way to destroy both in their weakened state.

7. She notices Arthur's son, Mordred, all alone while his father is away, and secretly manipulates him to come to the decision to kill everyone as to avoid dying by Jorm.

8. The plan succeeds, and she watches as Mordred carries out her work. When Arthur returns, you can bet that she was filled to the brim with joy as she watched the father and son duel

9. Mordred dies, which is both a glee and a drawback, as even though Morgan loves seeing Arthur killing the last memento of his wife, he still lives, and no doubt will Camelot be restored

10. She then lies in wait, trying to plan another way to beat Arthur, but Camelot is restored, and she can't do anything really

11. She hears that Arthur and Merlin have left Camelot and have entered into Avalon, and Morgan watches cautiously as the current events play out (Jorm's defeat, Set and Horus, Olorun's crowning as ruler, Persephone and her plan, Cthulhu, and now Tiamat), waiting for the perfect time to strike

12. Which is now."
Smite,"Just throwing it our there to show how broken this game is atm with the crit even with the buff to spectral. Give it a watch if you want to see for yourself, this happened to me in a few ranked games so I thought I would record it to see how OP it actually is.",[https://youtu.be/br2zDHWzXwg](https://youtu.be/br2zDHWzXwg)
Smite,Ranked questions how Tp works,I won 8 games in a row in gold 2 and my Tp went no where but lost 3 and I got ranked down why is this happening it started last week I was Platinum 4 on the brink of Platinum 3 it's like my wins don't count but my losses do I'm getting frustrated from this it's making me not wanna play anymore
Smite,Smite on Mac,"Hey all, mac owner here.  I currently use bootcamp to play smite on my mac, which works just fine, but is a hassle to switch between operating systems.  I understand that the reason smite is not available on mac right now is that mac no longer supports 32 bit games.  When I start smite on windows though, I have the option to play 64 bit.  Why do they not just put this on mac?  I know nothing about code so please forgive me if I’m being dumb."
Smite,Osiris jungle builds?,So I enjoy Osiris solo built AS focus with deaths toll and was wondering how I may build him in jungle?
Smite,No progress towards Chichen Pizza Xbalanque in viewer store?,"Even though Ive been claiming viewer points and they have been going to my account, I still have zero progress to the Chicen Pizza Xbalanque skin. I've definitely been getting my viewer points though because I got the notification in client when I unlocked them. Anyone else having this problem?"
Smite,Opinions on next smite crossover???,"Hi guys! I'm still relatively new to the game but I am loving it so far. i was wondering what you guys think the next big crossover will be?? To my knowledge there has been avatar ( so bummed I missed that) and TMNT. 

p.s. I get all my info from my brother who has been playing for a **long** time but that being said his info also could not be correct lol"
Smite,Debate: Is Support The Easiest Role?,"I’m just curious as to what everything thinks the easiest role is and i don’t see how their can be an argument against Support being the easiest.

For starters, I’m not roasting support mains. There is a HUGE difference between good supports and bad supports. 

I’m just saying, Jungle and Mid have to be the hardest. Carry is hard just because you don’t have huge AOE damage like Mid laners do and you have to be a lot more accurate. 

I just think, in reality if anyone ever has to fill a roll in ranked, Support is by far the easiest role to fill. Here are my reasons why.

1. Most supports gods have pretty standard, easy to use kits. 

2. Supports are tanky. It’s a lot easier to die as a full build Scylla than a full build Geb.

3. 70% of the Supports job is just to STAY with your squishy teammates and keep them alive. Obviously harder to do if you have bad teammates but still Supports have less stress about being accurate and getting kills and more stress on keeping their teammates alive.

Again, i am saying their is a CLEAR difference between someone who mains Support and someone just filling the roll. But i feel like if there’s any role that someone should play Fill on the Support role is by far the easiest one for them to take"
Smite,Weird Idea for Smite: St. Patrick,"Saint Patrick's Day is coming up and I've recently been learning more about some of the more wild legends about him. What if he got into Smite, he would probably be in the Celtic pantheon and be a mage. I wonder what you guys think about this funny idea."
Smite,Discordia+CDR= a match made in heaven,"I've been running Discordia a lot lately. She RIPS, especially once you've built a lot of penetration and CDR on her. 

My favorite build: archmages gem, blue boots, spear of deso, soul gem, obs shard, cap it off with rod of tahuti and begin the carnage. 

You can absolutely spam abilities in the late game. If you build enough CDR, you may not need her 3 for too much besides invisibility in the late game (although the CDR boost helps during the entire game).

Yesterday I was running a conquest mid, and the other team had a Bellona jungle (no clue why, but okay). She tried to gank, I hit her with my 2, threw my 1, and her health dropped so low that I didn't even need my ult to finish her off. Killed her with an AA. Discordia does so much damage! I was absolutely spanking anyone in my path.

Any other Discordia fans out there?"
Smite,Safe mode,"Yesterday I played a ranked conquest game. It was a pretty good server and no one on either team had issues. We won and after the game my team got no mmr due to safe mode. Why would this happen if there wasnt anything wrong with the server.

Before safe mode only happened if the server was messed up and people would get 800 ping but there was nothing like that here."
Smite,Viewer points not working,Does anyone else have any issues with getting viewer points? I try linking my acc again but still doesn't work
Smite,Duo Pains,"My SO and I play together and she's just getting into conquest (she plays jungle Rata for now). My experience has been fine solo, but every game I dou with her is just problematic teammates left and right. 10 minute surrender calls, rage quits, ADCs that push up on tower with zero vision. 

I know that because we're a duo some of our teammates are probably lower rank than us (and we're not great to begin with &gt;.&lt;), but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this. Can't really move up the mmr when we constantly lose games to this behavior."
Smite,"Legit Question: In your opinion, in order to get better at ranked conquest, is it better to play/practice the game with very few select characters or to master 2/3 characters?",Let’s say you do you practice to learn your characters in casuals first before going ranked because of course you don’t ‘learn character basics’ in ranked
Smite,Good magic damage junglers?,"I’m trying to find some good magic damage junglers, I usually play assassins or guardians in the jungle but was wondering if there are any good mages who can jungle?"
Smite,Role Q in ranked,"The role Q was an amazing addition to smite which allowed for us to play the roles we want. A big issue with this role Q is that it doesn't put you on a team with a open slot but instead uses a system based on how often you get your role. Im a solo and jungle player and I've been trying to get a higher MMR in ranked. I started off the season with 1600 MMR and lost my first game losing 100. Thats fine, I can get that 100 back from a game or 2. I get solo and I'm able to hyper farm and carry my team. This happens for another 2 games and I finally got back to 1600 MMR. I que up again and im at the top of the team picking and banning. I notice that the guy at the very bottom of the team got solo. Atleast I can play jungle I think, only to realize that I'm not jungle either? I got support. Some how while I'm top MMR of the team, I got support while the guy at the very bottom got solo. Doesn't make any sense but I decide to play and do my best with a role I dont enjoy nor am very good at. Within the first 10 minutes I witness my solo Laner go 0 5 with the jungler continually ganking mid just to die without any attempt to farm. Im forced to rotate a little earlier than I'd like and I'm able to play as a aggressive support stealing buffs and helping my team farm. Just for none of them to change their strategy. Games over within 20 minutes. This goes on for another 4 matches and I lose 300 MMR. 

I don't understand why in the ranked system the better player wouldn't get the role they pick. I know some of you will say ""If you can't carry your team, you don't deserve to rank up"" which makes a little sense but when I'm able to consistently carry my team from solo lane just to be once again pit in another match where I'm support and can't do much with a team who will W key anything. In casual the Role Q system makes sense, but in ranked where it is more important for a strong team in their preferred roles to be able to handle themselves, why wouldn't MMR be taken into account? Or maybe do what Overwatch did with the different que times for each role because I'd rather spend 6+ minutes waiting to play the role I'd like to play than be put in a game where I'm miserable and forced to play through the 30 minutes.

I'd like to know everyone's opinions or others ideas.
(Please stay civil)

Edit: It seems a lot people are just reading this and choosing to respond with basically ""Learn to play"", but not understanding this post is focused on the idea that my team feed in roles where others can carry."

Smite,Best way to counter healers?,"One of the biggest problems with this game, for me, is healers. I mainly play Joust with friends and we keep running into these Warrior-Aphrodite combos, or other gods that just heal like crazy with other healing gods on their teams. I played LoL for years before I switched over, and that was never that big of an issue over there.

Keep in mind, I'm asking because I'm relatively new to this game, was never that great in League, and still trying to familiarize myself with items. Most games I'll play a Guardian and rush Pestilence, but it doesn't seem to do anything.

Another question - can you stack antiheal items?

TL:DR - Any suggestions for anti-heal items for mainly Guardians, but also Mages and Hunters?"
Smite,Voice pack bundle?,"I would be way more likely to spend my hard earned gems on this. Skins are great but what I would love is a voice pack bundle. 5 gods, 10 gods, 20 gods, let me select the gods I want and I get their baseline voice packs at a small discount. The default voice is starting to make me crazy.

Does something like this already exist?"

Anyone else?

Updated (RESOLVED): A UI message came up after alt+tabbing for 10-ish minutes while I research the issue and it said ""Your request could not be actioned at this point"" and now I can hit ""PLAY"" again. I didn't fix anything; it resolved itself. #thanksobama"

Like idc that much for game history or stuff like that , but when u get 3 games in a row with a dc and some of them in ranked , just why is it this way ? like its just really frustrating that other counts for them as a win when u could have been the one winning the game .

i know they changed ranked MMR for this not so long ago but u can take it a step further and just delete the game from ur history simple as that .

idk if anyone can comment on this id be happy to hear."

[https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/oDP4roPAAsTT](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/oDP4roPAAsTT)

&amp;#x200B;

This PDF contains:

\- More than 50 gods/characters (CR 20) with unique abilities based on their in-game counterparts

\- A new point of view of damage and attacks, considering the real-time pace of the in-game battles

\- Passive and active abilities 'translated' to DnD 5e system in a balanced manner

\- Legendary Actions as actions that can be executed in different paces than the in-game rythm

\- Special reactions triggered by in-game oriented circunstances

&amp;#x200B;

It's not finished yet and has to be reviwed, as well. I'm currently on Hun Batz and I have plans to make all the gods.

PS: Creative freedom was taken while making some of the more 'customized' abilities, attacks and actions

I unlocked King Arthur and have been enjoying him, but haven't felt all that effective in the constant team fight. Any suggestions on op heroes, my buddies are playing tanks and a dps mage.

Smite,I think there's a good case to lower the level requirements to starter upgrades.,"Starter upgrades are cool, they are powerful, in-fact they are build defining. The only downside as many people have pointed out is that games can often be decided or completely over before getting to build them. 

This is not only unfun but really slows down balance/testing these items as there are just so many factors that keep you from getting a good feel for them.

However, I don't think that games are actually to short in general. The game pace feels fair and fun with even teams, which is what we should be balancing around because do we really want longer uneven team games?  


So if game pace feels good and starters upgrades are cool when we get to use them, the solution seems obvious to me, we lower the level requirements for them. Maybe 17 for normal, 15 for supports.  


Now these items are strongly stated and simply lower the level required could cause some weird spikes. I would suggest putting more balance into the upgrade cost. Making stronger upgrades cost a bit more over their slightly weaker counter parts. They shouldn't be so insane that they lock you out till 20 anyway but should require you to plan them in your build path. Many of the upgrades are also percentage based so they should scale decently at earlier points

Currently starter upgrades come in around 5-6 item, I think 4-5 item would feel slightly better.

The other benefits are that the gold gain upgrades would feel more useful, and you may finally get to use the items in short game modes like arena of joust."

Smite,Get rid of Zeus' Detonate,"Specifically, all the free dmg that it does.

I don't know what you'd like to replace it with, I'd suggest maybe a stun with the bare minimum of dmg that might kill someone on 1 hp, but this Pseudo Execute is more disgusting than Hebo with all 4 of his Ults.

Smite,Alternative way to play Assault,"Was simply wondering how many other people play or have played the game this way. I only play assault in game, and always with a friend. We have one rule: person with the most kills at the end wins. Everything goes, killstealing, trading for their best god and then rerolling said god, surrendering when you're ahead in kills, you name it we've done it.  

Its a total blast and has kept us playing the game the past years. It's a special experience, boxing in an enemy in the side lane and playing chicken to see who attacks first so the other can get the last hit in (and then both getting killed).

Also probably good time to apologize to any teammates that lost a game because I didn't attack the mino when I was behind on kills."
Smite,If they ever decide to remodel Anhur... Let him keep his jump/hop animation,It’s so adorable.
Smite,Ranked conquest TP?,So for the past three days I have been on a winning streak of 7 and each game I have received 13 TP points for matches that are 40 minutes long... is that right? If I were to lost BOOM 30tp gone like huh?!? Can someone explain or is there something wrong?
Smite,opinions and/or idea's on god nerfs/buffs,"which god would you like to see be buffed or nerfed?
Opinions on recent nerfs and/or buffs?"
Smite,So i've been thinking...,"everyone knows about the relation between SWK and Hun Batz, right?

how SWK's old model and abilities gave birth to Hun Batz, so i thought, why not do the same with Neith?.

right now, i think neith in her current state is a GREAT misinterpretation of her actual mythology, the only thing she does get right is her weapon.

Heck, her name translates to SHE IS THE TERRIFYING ONE

She is supposed to be the mother of RA and consort of SET

And right now, looking at the recent release of Tiamat, its clean that Hi-rez KNOWS how to make primordial beings.

however, i understand that she's too iconic for the game to just ditch her current look, so here's the plan:

\-First, we give her old and abilities look to a new god, maybe Cleopatra (if anyone has a better idea let me know)

\-Second, we recreate Neith from scratch, maybe keeping her passive as it ties to her themes, but with new abilities and look

\-Her new look would be something humanoid, not human, HUMANOID, remember, we are talking about an primordial being, related to the primordial waters perhaps?

\-Release them in a similar way to horus and set.

i know my idea is far-fetched and hard to do, i just wanted to share these thoughts with you all.

what do you think?"
Smite,Ranked Duo Queue Conquest not working?,"So I've been trying to duo queue with my friend. Originally it gave us the error that we either need to have a close MMR or we needed to play a game. Well we both played enough games solo to get our rankings, and our MMR are within 30 of each other. It still keeps saying we either need to have a closer MMR or we need to play a ranked game first. What gives?"
Smite,Solo queuing,"I'm at my wit's end. I usually play warriors so it's my job to dive, create distractions, apply CC, and deal mild damage. It seems most times I try to do this none of my team follows me and I die for nothing. Idk what to do when up against a team where no one feeds. Wait til someone does something stupid? What if that never happens? If all I do is stand around and kill minions I get poked out by the mages and have to back leaving my team down a man."
Smite,Lag on EU solutions,"Hello everyone I have been enjoying the heck out of the game so far, but im located in Europe and I get around 180 ping on EU servers which I think is inadequate, as I average between 40-60 on steam and riot servers.

Smite,Tips for a noob against a ranged solo lander like anhur Anubis etc,I almost always play tyr or cerb in the solo lane. Whenever I play tyr I struggle against mages and hunters in the solo lane. It’s so frustrating. Do I stand under tower? Do I rush antihero cause they always build deathstoll or some sort of life’s real item and they never stand near their wave so I either clear and get poked to hell or let them clear and get poked to hell.
Smite,[SPOILER] Hopes and ideas for the portrayal of the god after Gilgamesh,"Aside from Gilgamesh, the god I am most excited for this year is the goddess who is officially confirmed to be coming after him: Morgan le Fay. A long-awaited big name in Arthurian lore, she has an incredibly rich mythology and I’m intrigued by how Hirez is going to mesh it into Smite. I just hope they don’t take the least effort route and make her a one-dimensional villain like she is in a lot of later Arthurian stories.

If you look at the earliest versions of her, Morgan is entirely a fae being, a goddess even. She comes from another world, is a powerful healer and mainly arrives to take Arthur to Avalon at the end of his life. However, in the high Middle Ages stories about Arthur and his Round Table, she gets pidgeonholed into an antagonistic role without good reasons for her motivations. She just seems to want to harm Arthur and co. “for the evuls”, sometimes because she has a rivalry with Guinevere. Strangely, even these versions tend to agree that Morgan eventually makes up with Arthur (very suddenly) and takes him to Avalon. But the result is that Morgan has been relegated mainly to villain roles in modern media, with only a few works acknowledging her potential for complexity or benevolence.

My wish is for Smite’s Morgan to at least have some complexity. If she has bad motives, let it be for a very understandable reason from her perspective, and let her have a chance to also do good. In essence, make her a more better realized version of Persephone (whose plan was indeed interesting, but ended up coming off as a bit dumb). The potential to tap into her better nature is already there as Smite’s Arthur and Merlin are based mostly on early sources like Geoffrey of Monmouth, the same ones that portray Morgan as a benevolent fairy. But from the clues already put out by Hirez she may be trending more towards her later versions, with the illusions and manipulation. The third and fourth chapters of the Talons of Tyranny event are called “Dark Magic” and “Queen of Darkness”, which may also refer to the black magic used by her in the later stories. 

I also wonder how exactly Morgan will tie into Smite’s lore, seeing how Arthurians like Merlin have already been interpreted. In particular, Smite Merlin’s background as the last survivor of a previous race of gods provides excellent story potential. What if Smite Morgan is another survivor from this race, whose trauma of feeling powerless against Jormungandr has pushed her onto a path of power seeking? If she is coming in the wake of whatever the fallout of Talons of Tyranny is, what is her link to the events surrounding Tiamat? What will be her links to the gods after her like the Irish goddess, Charybdis and Atlas? I really can’t wait to find out. Morgan le Fay has the potential to be a well-realized and impactful plot driver, I just hope she isn’t another evil Morgan like in a lot of modern popular culture."
Smite,When should you say anything in between the lines of gg ; wp ; ez etc.,"Hot take:  
I don't think everyone saying gg no matter what the game was like is ""sportsmanlike"" if anything I find it extremely offensive in some occasions. It doesn't matter if you win or lose I think the terms gg and wp are to be used in a non-toxic behavior only when a game was actually good, as in there was competition in the game and it wasn't one sided. Saying ez unless obviously being sarcastic is toxic in every single situation.  


Example:  
If I'm playing a jungler and together with my team I've completely shut down every lane just farming kills full well knowing that we can end the game but instead extending it to farm them even more, even saying ""gg wp"" after the game has finished would be like spitting at their face."

Well, those 900 gems apparently just bought me Battleship Heaven because I didn't unlock either of the new skins (did not receive them after restarting either).

Then you pick one of the worst jungles in the league sam4soccer a man who got carried by his team to victory back in season 6 and you know how you know he got carried he lost to his old team last year and then PK won again and guess what they did it without sam so obviously useless player.

Why don't they have a spawn timer like everything else in the game? I saw the minions in lane and thought, nah, they can't make it all the way past T2 and then the phoenix.

Cu Chulain, King Arthur and Guan Yu have been terrorising solo for ages, I don’t see any nerfs to their core items.

No instead they nerf all the gods who build berserker as a core just because some hunters built it 1/5 games. Their reasoning is that they didn’t want to restrict hunters from using it so they just nerfed it, but they may as well have just restricted it because what hunter is gonna pick this up now? Barely anyone picked this up on hunters anyway and they’re surely not going to now it’s been nerfed like this.

It just makes autoattack solos like Amaterasu, Vamana, Bellona etc. worse, some of which weren’t that powerful in the first place."
Smite,Please never do another hard reset,"I understand the logic to it, gives people a chance to all start with the same footing. But in reality it just ruins matchmaking for ranked games. And  I want to pretence this post with saying I don't believe I'm a player without fault, I've stayed in a fight too long every now and then or got greedy and stayed in lane without wards, but this has to be said.  


I've been trying to just grind my way back up and literally if you win or lose is entirely dependant on if your team is feeling like throwing the game, not to be salty or anything its just factual. Feels like in lower ranks most players are pretty solid at the early game and just decide to run into every fight without wards or a team to back them up.   


It's so frustrating because you can play perfectly the entire match, forge them a huge lead and you'll still lose because in the end the enemy team can just catch up. My last game for instance, had a bastet jungle so obviously not a late game carry. Her and our support chased a hel into their titan without wards - was then kicking off at me for not going with them. Should note we'd already got their phoenix so there was nothing to push for and fire was about to respawn. Also should note their comp was hel and aphrodite and I had to literally beg them to buy antiheal and some still didnt.   


Same goes on the other side of it, any win I've had has been an absolute stomp (and ngl a lot of those early game stomps have led to loses from players tunnel vision). It doesn't feel like I'm testing my skill to see how high I can get up the ranks it just feels like I'm rolling some dice and seeing who's going to go afk 25mintues in because they died in a 1v5 or call to take fire with the whole enemy team up and no wards.  
Its just a not fun environment for every game to be constantly most wards, top damage, least deaths and highest gold and still just be haemorrhaging MMR. I'm literally worse off now than I was at the start of the reset and I understand I've 100% not played perfectly throughout these games but there's a difference between that and literally handing your team a win and them slapping it out your hand with a bitchy comment of ""ThAttt WAsss GAMeeEE!"" because I didn't follow them into their wardless 2v5 at the enemy titan."

Smite,Laning Phase Penalty,"There is always an extreme amount of pressure on at least 1 lane each season. This season it seems to be mid.

I know this will effect you if you die as well, but you'd die a lot less if you warded and people weren't cringe ganking. It would also allow people to push towers faster if a team decided they wanted to cringe gank. Any thoughts?"

Not sure if it's just me, but I have a feeling that people at Hirez really don't like hunters being meta/strong. For the past seasons it's always been warriors shitting on hunters (thorns, having really good defense items while also dealing a shitton of damage to squishies), now after one month of hunters being at the forefront they immediately nerf the items. ADC is my least favorite role, always thought it was extremely boring to just afk farm in lane for 20 minutes so you could ~maybe have a chance to kill a Glad Shield Thorns King Arthur running at you in the late game. This past month was the first time I actually had some fun in the role after avoiding it like the plague in S7."

Smite,"Nirrti, Goddess of Chaos and Misfortune","###Nirrti

####Goddess of Chaos and Misfortune

Hindu

Assassin

**Lore:** Nirrti is often prayed to in order to prevent misfortune. She is associated with the South-West direction. To my knowledge, she has no stories directly associated with her.

Chaos runs rampant of the battleground. And where there is chaos, there is Nirrti...

**Appearance:** Blond hair, Dark skin, Wears a black dress and cloak, Wields a scimitar

**Passive - Bad Luck:** Each time a nearby Enemy god is afflicted with a Hard CC, Nirrti gains Movement Speed for a duration. This can stack up to 5 times.

Range: 40 units

Movement Speed Buff: 8% per stack

Duration: 10 seconds

**Ability 1 - Strike from Darkness:** Nirrti Dashes forward in a shadowy blur, dealing Damage and passing through Enemies in a wide line. If she hits more than one Enemy, Enemies hit turn and attack each other briefly.

Range: 50 units

Damage: 80/145/200/255/310 (+75% of Physical Power)

Madness Duration: .75 seconds

Cost: 65/70/75/80/85

Cooldown: 15 seconds

**Ability 2 - Agent of Chaos:** Nirrti summons a shadowy figure, who transforms into a random Enemy god, mimicking their Speed, Health, and Basic Attack Damage. This Pet attacks the nearest Enemy in range, prioritizing Enemy gods. The Pet has no protections, but its Health is hidden, always appearing to be full. This Pet lasts 15 seconds, and this Ability goes on Cooldown after the Pet disappears.

Cost: 70

Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 seconds

**Ability 3 - Mistake:** Nirrti fires a narrow beam of energy from her sword, dealing Damage and applying a Mistake Debuff to Enemy gods hit.

Debuff Duration: 5 seconds

Cost: 60/65/70/75/80

Radius: 40 units

Mesmerize Duration: 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds

Cost: 90

Cooldown: 80 seconds"

Smite,Smite's Ranked scene needs help.,"I'm not sure if the community is filled with toxic people that turn on whomever has the worst stats in everyone else's games but it's happened it most ranked games where my team is losing.

I was the ping/VGS spam speed bag for this round because I threw up a pause vote because I needed to go do something urgent IRL they would have been a 20 second dash. My team instavotes no and  the jungle spams that I rock. I put up BRB in VGS and leave. I came back now down 3 levels and they were mad that I left. I do not understand why people vote no to pause, if it's up someone needs to do something.

Either way the rest of the team followed suit falling in line with the jungle ping spamming me. I threw up a couple of surrenders because at this point why even bother? It's very rare that people change course and decide to be nice. 40 minutes in and we're all level 20 but we can't kill a thing because we have a jungle guan but it's still my fault. Eventually three shifted and it was now the Nu Wa's fault because she was ulting to early. At this point I'm just relieved they've stopped pinging me. 

Is this what it's like above gold?! If so I'd rather be in Elo hell. I have no idea how pinging and spamming you rock is supposed to make anyone better, just surrender the match at that point of you're not going to help correct what exactly they're doing wrong.

Smite,As a new player,"So smite combines two game types I really enjoy moba and rpg.  Ive been playing it for a week now and am almost level 20 but Ive noticed a few things that alarm me.

Account linking doesn’t work for all of the options at the moment.  My region has a very low player base so I have to play on north american servers.  Alot of the “free skins” are linked to dead games/services.  Playing conquest in pre level 30 is full of smurfs that rage at you for not knowing the role or rotations perfectly, you miss a shot and get told to “play arena”.  Ive had several 20/0 kd games in arena, its literally because conquest needs to be played to be learned.

The combination of these are worrying because it hints at a diminishing player base rather than a growing one.  As a new player I dont want to be told theres a bunch of free stuff but it ended two years ago and is no longer obtainable when it wasnt even a limited skin.  I dont want to click on an ingame link and it to goto a 404 error page doesnt exist on the smitegame website.

Edit: I apologise that this is mostly a rant but I had that happen in a game right after spending an hour of not being able to play plus errors linking anything to my hirez account.

Its fucking annoying playing against this every match once you get into Masters/GM ques. Make them go against PC players and not the people with automatic delay"
Smite,What was your longest game?,What is the longest smite game you've ever had and how did it end?
Smite,Who are the Hardest/Easiest Gods to Play?,"I know Smite used to kind of have a ranking when selecting a God on their difficulty but i felt some of them were wrong / I’m not sure they even do that anymore.

In your opinion who are the Gods that are the Hardest and Easiest to play based on mechanics?

I’m trying to expand my God pool and i need some easy ones to master first.

My opinion
Hardest - Ullr, Serqet, Persephone, Morrigan, King Arthur and Set, i literally can’t play Set

Easiest - i don’t think i have an opinion for the “easiest” i think most Guardians, Mages and Hunters are pretty easy to play. I think Assassins and Warriors vary a bunch from god to god, making them hard to play.

Anyway what do you think?"
Smite,Deaths tolls &amp; Transcendence,"So take Neith for instance or any god that you would build transcendence on as an ADC, is there any point in starting Deaths toll if you build Transcendence? Or would you just go a different starter like cowl if you are building Transcendence?"
Smite,Any advice for times when teammates play really passive and let enemy team dictate the pace and push us hard?,"So I'm a returning player and has been playing for the last couple of weeks and have noticed a odd trend.  Having team mates just sitting back and farming minions or leaving lane to go jungling in team fights whenever I innitiate a fight with a stun, pull etc.  Now I'm not doing this when I'm alone nor am I doing it with squishy gods either.  I'm talking Ares, Guan, Bellona when the tanks not building tank or initiating for whatever reason. I make damn sure people are around me when I go in and what happens?  My team in that instant decide to either hang back to farming minions, left to jungle, and in the worst case back at full hp cause I guess they wanted to buy something and this occurs multiple times.  I then myself start to play passive cause I figured no one is gonna back me up and I don't want to feed which leads to the team be pressured into stupid forced fights where teammates are not together and teammates caught out alone trying to farm minions.  So What am I suppose to do in a situation thats gotten out of hand cause players don't want to fight aka the pussy footing.  One answer I was told by these passive players is that they were waiting to catch aggressive folks out of position but I'm having a hard time believing that."

Smite,Wondering What Others Think - Voice Packs,"Sorry if this isn't the place. A few friends and I were talking about the voice packs in Smite. Some we find really fun and interesting, i.e. the latest Baba Yaga skin. They're different, quirky and often quite comical.   


However I find with a lot of skins, the voice packs are pretty boring and plain. Yeah the occasional different voiceline to fit the theme of the skin but all in all super boring still.   


What do you guys think? Would you be more inclined to purchase a VP if it was more silly and fun. OR Do you prefer the plain ones that just fit the theme?

Smite,Baba Yaga circle shaped one.,"Anyone else miss this (by enemy being in middle) and immediately hate Janus? 

Should it be changed more in line with the Janus change?

With as frustrating as it is at times, I don’t think so, the ability hits too hard. I am interested to see what people think since I saw a similar post on Artio’s vs Tiamat’s basics."
Smite,Meme Monday!,You know the drill.
Smite,Idea: minor remodels,"Could we get minor remodels on specific things like:
Give abstet a cat face.
Remodel Terra's hair
Replace the mechanical serqets tail by a flesh one.
Reduce the geral model scale of Hera, Persefone and Pele.
Remove or replace by other thing that white strange ""hair"" or ""veil"" from the Nox back."
Smite,Starting to think that I just shouldn't play certain gods in casual due to blind pick,"I have been thinking about this recently I wanted to know other's thoughts. When I get a role I'm not queuing for and sometimes for the roles I am queuing for (maybe I just wanna change it up) I'll pick a god I don't often play. The problem is if this god is someone who is easily countered and the enemy team end up countering me in some way then the game is pretty horrible... Should I be learning that character to do well against their team or do you think it is better to just avoid certain gods in a blind pick situation? An example would be me playing Isis against a Tyr,Anubis and Ao."
Smite,Noob With Questions,"Hi all! Probably the things Im gonna ask is already answered so sorry if these are repeating questions. 
First of all there are three different packs to purchase which one should I purchase? 
Secondly which game modes are better for understanding the game mechanics/tactics etc. for a beginner? Thank you and sorry again!"
Smite,Season 8 Toxicity,"Thought it'd be a good idea to get the opinion of the masses on Season 8 generally but more specifically, matchmaking and toxicity in the current game. As a disclaimer I have around 1100 hours in Smite and have been playing since mid-season 4. Mostly play conquest and assault, hovering around Gold and Platinum in Ranked conquest. The ""average player"", if you will. 

Anyone who's played Smite for an extended period of time will know that the occasional toxic interaction is almost inevitable. People get invested in the game, it has the ability to tilt people very quickly and over the years I've been able to largely look past it but to me, something has shifted this season and I can't quite put my finger on it. 

Picks and bans. I've never known a time where in so many games, before it's started people are so often arguing in the pre-game lobby. ""Trash bans GG"", ""you obviously have no idea how to play this game"" etc etc. Yes some gods are better than others and if people are banning Khumba/Ganesh/Ah Puch that's a little sus but there are a lot of super strong gods at the moment and you can't ban all of them. Starting a game in this environment tends to have big impact on the game itself too; people go in with a chip on their shoulder, and if anything goes wrong in the early game it's a ""write off"". People BM'ing, people AFK'ing, trolling and so on. The Mute button is great and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't make good use of it already but it only goes so far. 

The matchmaking also seems to be pretty skewed. I know changes were made at the beginning of the season, including the hard reset, but a lot of games rarely seem to be anything close to balanced. 

There are good things about this new season. The starter items, albeit not all executed as well as they could have been, offer build variety. I think the new map is good, better than S7 at least. I'm a support main and support is in a good place right now, I can't speak for the other roles but the thoughts of those that do play them would be welcome. 

My main theory is YouTube. As Smite has grown in popularity, so has the content creator scene for it. I almost get the feeling that people are of the opinion that because they watch Pro-level players, they can 1) replicate that level of play in game even with the same rogue builds and 2) hold others accountable if they do not play to that level. The first problem with that is that point 1 is just not true. The vast majority of us can not consistently play to the level of people like FineO, Panda, Zap etc, that's why they're professionals. The second problem is everyone has bad games. Just because someone isn't playing well in YOUR game doesn't mean they're shit. GM players and even Pro players have bad innings, we're all human. It's not an excuse to jump down their throats and be abusive. In the past few weeks I've seen it all; racism, personal threats, wishes of cancer, some aimed at me and some not. You should always report these but those seem to dissipate into the ether. 

This has got a bit waffly but the purpose of this post is to remind everyone that we're here in this sub-reddit because we love Smite, for better or worse. When it's working well, it's the dog's. But the levels of aggro and BM have hit what feels like a new high and you can't fully enjoy the game for what it is in that environment. Throwing shade is not going to help a new or badly performing player hard-carry. Be productive, offer advice respectfully, and we might all be better for it."
Smite,Is Smite's official website having technical difficulties?,"I just noticed that the official website for Smite is no longer accessible, with no word from Hi-Rez on Twitter or anything either. All that shows up is a completely blank page. Is this known, or a new  development?"
Smite,honest question ... why does your balance team suck so bad?,"same characters are banned for months and nothing is done about them ... you're gonna have like 4-6 hunters every game soon. 

are you balancing around assault for some reason?

Smite,Favorite “incorrect” or non-optimal way to play/build a god?,"Like the title says, what’s your favorite god/build that isn’t exactly optimal or meta? 

A couple of my favorites:
Attack speed Hun Batz: Cause monkey man funny when attack fast. Hastened is good for this

Attack speed Chaac: Cast a bunch of abilities and you smack people a lot. Hastened or frost bound for this but hastened is extra funny

Tank Baron Samedi: heal is a flat amount plus a small amount of power plus 10% of missing health. Get like Ethereal staff and gem of iso for fun

What’s your favorites?"
Smite,Is there still gonna be a 2x BP weekend at all?,"I know all passes have a 2x BP weekend at the start and end of their duration but, for some reason this one hasn't had one yet. Starting to wonder if we're getting one at all, been taking it slow so, still need some levels."
Smite,Anyone else having trouble ganking duos this season?,"I just feel like because the map is so huge and I don’t wanna miss out on any farm, I can sometimes go entire matches without ganking duos once, it’s like I simply forget it exists. I’m sorry to all you carry and support mains out there, I’m that jungler in your games that sits in right the whole time and then spams “Ok!” when you’re underleved in team fights, I’m sorry 😭."
Smite,Persona 5 battle pass brainstorm,"So I don’t think this is actually going to happen for a multitude of reasons, but I thought it’d be a fun little thought experiment to speculate about what a Persona 5 battle pass would look like in SMITE. I’ve only been able to come up with a few ideas so far, so I wanted to see what you guys might like to see in a persona 5 battle pass or what reskin would make sense for each of the characters. Also, this post and comments section is sure to be filled with spoilers, so you have been warned.

This is really all I have so far:

Joker - Loki?

Morgana - Cupid?

Ryuji - Thor maybe? With a club instead of hammer?

Ann - Bastet

Yusuke - Susano, reflavor the storm/water with ice like they did with Zuko

Makoto - Mercury, uses Johanna for ult

Haru - Hera?

Akechi - Loki, for obvious reasons

Any ideas, anywhere I can fill in the blanks? Biggest hole here is obviously joker - I was thinking that Loki would make sense for him, but obviously that’s gotta be Akechi. I was thinking maaaaaybe Ao Kuang? But I have no idea what his abilities would really look like (specifically his 2 and ult).

Oh, and since Futaba isn’t on here, it would only make sense for them to add her as an announcer pack specifically."
Smite,Intermediate Tips for a “Beginner” Player,"Hey everyone, so my friends have been playing Smite quite a bit more than any other game (we play on Xbox) and I do my best to learn from them, but I also have the hardest time playing it for so long without getting bored or getting trashed on by good enemies. I should mention that it’s most likely due to them being high into the 100s in Player Level, whereas I’m around ~28 I believe. So far, I’m pretty decent with Fenrir, Anubis, and I’m learning Artemis a little (just because).

I came here wondering what all tips or recommendations y’all had for a “starter” player like me. I know I shouldn’t play with them a whole lot because of the player level gap, I plan to play more by myself tonight, but I also like having teammates that know what they’re doing, you know?

I really appreciate any and all comments. I’ll try my best to reply as much as I can, but I’m currently on my lunch break.

Edit: I should mention, I’m mainly asking questions because it feels as if there are so many items and different builds that it feels super overwhelming to a new player. I try to follow their builds they give me and I have a pretty solid Fenrir build at the moment. If there’s any videos y’all recommend I watch, I’ll gladly give them a shot too."
Smite,How to counter chang'e in solo lane?,"I has always been a solo main, but this season I am struggling against chang'e solo almost every game.
I just cannot fight her. She clears better and pokes me, and when my jg tries to gank she just ults and get out (or ult and kill someone of us).
If I start with mag def the enemy jungler does a lot of damage and babysits the lane, and if I buy phys def chang'e destroys me.
I try to start with tainted steel, but I dont see that it works, she keeps healing too much.

Any tip to win the lane or, at least, dont be hard humilliated?
I play king arthur, guan yu, cthulhu and sometimes hades, cu chulainn too but worse."

* Axolotl Ratatoskr (Nothing needs to be said here)
* Gecko Gladiator Xing Tian (God Tier Annoyance) (woohoo the forest is freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
* Bunny Bomber Aphrodite (Aphrodite. enough said)
* Midgardian Macaque Hun Batz (His curses voiceline is just a funny growl)
* Standard Tiamat Voicepack (Long voicelines that get spam abused I love it though)
* All TMNT skins (Mainly Raphael Loki)
* Avatar Merlin (""I am I am I am I am the avatar after all"")
* Standard Danzaburou voicepack (Weird raccoon dog noises)

Smite,Epic games launcher,"Steam is being an absolute pain when launching Smite, it's basically a coin toss as to whether it decides to open it properly instead of freezing. Can't even bring up task manager to shut it and try again, so resetting my PC is the only solution. 

Will switching to Epic games fix the problem? Or does it also have issues opening Smite? 

Thanks in advance."
Smite,Mulan Solo in S8?,"I like Mulan a lot, I think besides Arthur she's the most fun warrior to play. I played her a lot in S7 but have yet to in S8. For anyone who has tried her what do you think? Is she still super fun until the 20 minute mark hits?"
Smite,If Mulan and Guan Yu had more interactions,"Guan Yu: ""Remember your training, Mulan. It will aid you greatly in this forthcoming battle.""

Guan Yu: ""Be careful Mulan! Our foes fight not with the weapons of mortals!""

Smite,Best gods for a complete noob,"So I just played smite with my friend for the first time. And by that I mean it was his first time playing the game. He is new to gaming in general and that includes mobas. We jumped in an arena game and I tried to teach him what I could about how arena works. When it came time for him to choose a god, I made him play a tankier god so he wasn’t just getting farmed. He wanted to try out Ymir. I told him He’s free and pretty good, so go ahead. I told him to just keep auto leveling and buy on because telling him what to buy, where it was, and all that was difficult. He didn’t really like Ymir however, he said that he was too slow and him 1 was useless. So I’m curious what exactly I could get him to play and be okay with. I’m looking for something tanky again so he doesn’t get farm but simple and something with mobility. Any ideas?"
Smite,Why the Arena mode hate?,"I could be making more of it than it is, but it seems like Arena is seen as the ""lesser"" of the modes by a lot of folks, and I'm curious as to why. As someone who used to be into medievalism and took part in some really fun field fights, I love a good open field battle and have had some really fun, intense, Arena fights between well-matched (of course they're not always) teams. Is it because most professional eSports for MOBAs are Conquest-like modes? Is it because there's not enough complexity to Arena? I'm honestly curious, and I apologize if this is something that gets asked here often. Thanks in advance."

Smite,Ratatoskr needs a buff,"This patch is nice but I'm still waiting for them to make changes to ratatoskr's acorns. 
Only one out of the four of his acorns are actually usable anymore.

Thick bark and Evergreen acorns are bad, both have small healing tacked on and the 10% bonus protections and max health you can choose from and with only 25 physical power is is not enough considering that you that they're supposed to be able to replace boots. 

Bristlebush was actually pretty good, but the crit got nerfed and it's cost is too high to be useful and a ton of anti heal item are getting buffed.

Of course there's a few magical characters that are way better than physical but the majority are weaker than the physical ones even the physical healers deal a bunch of dmg while being extremely tanky. And the items that counter magical characters are extremely powerful too. You're always in disadvantage on a magical vs physical match and mostly of physical characters or almost all of them have really good mobility in their kit too."

Smite,Tips for two noobs?,"Me and my gf just started playing smite, and we are struggling hard. When playing conquest i usually go for support, while she is playing carry, so we can play together in one lane without disrupting the rest of the game.

She likes kukulkan the most, and im switching between athena and hel, and looking into buying artio.   


we are understanding the principles of the game modes, character skills and basic item management, but i cant grasp it when i see someone doing 641 dmg with one hit, while im stuck with 30ish with athena and 50-110 with hel.

Smite,Why does Zapman always end up on unproven rosters?,"TL;DR Why is Zapman on bottom tier team this season?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to preface this by saying I'm a casual SPL viewer so I don't know everything, but this is my view.  

Basically after S3, I feel like Zapman has been on garbage or unproven teams. There was that whole fiasco with Sam4Soccer who at the time was a rookie, and then unfortunately was kicked. Zapman hasn't really been on a ""top tier"" team for a long time. His last two championship runs were interesting. I don't think his team had the best players on his team despite winning. Now Zapman is on another unproven team. Why didn't his old roster want to go for the three-peat? Also, is Zapman overhyped?

Smite,Season 8 Solo Help,"I’ve been playing solo for the entirety of season 7 and have been having a hard time adjusting to season 8. I feel like it’s a trio lane, but your team is never there. The enemy solo can bounce around and do whatever because the support and jungle are always there. I can’t see my team rotating ever and lose a lot of games sitting in tower with a solo and jungle in front of me and a support behind me waiting for the team to rotate and getting all my farm sapped. Even if I get an early lead, a four man rotation evens the xp in one death. I ward the entrances to lane but when I hear three pings on it I know I’m dead. Solo isn’t a very easy lane to play from behind, especially this season it feels. Does anyone have any other opinion? At this point I’m close to leaving the role entirely. In my not so professional opinion this season so far is run by the jungle’s early ganks. One lane gank while farm is up and the game is already over for that lane unless something drastic happens. Appreciate any advice."
Smite,"Anybody else have this weird ""problem"", hopefully someone has a fix","Hoping this doesn't get auto-mod removed for posting about a glitch but maybe someone has a solution.

I use the Steam version like many, and that autologs you in. So last year I tried to get my friends into the game, not wanting to be up against lvl 100+ I made a smurf just to play with them. That was all fine and good, I was auto-logged in to my smurf and could logout and change accounts when I was playing solo ezpz.

They didn't like the game, that's okay not everyone does, so I stopped playing for a year and cut to now. Now the problem arises when I am on my main account. When I select ANYTHING that deals with friends (i.e. friends list, give gift in post game lobby, give gift in store, etc) my smurf comes in and creates a group with me to stop me from being lonely. Also, here's the funny part, my smurf is the party leader so I can't even search for a game. I do hear you before you post it, ""Why don't you just leave the party, dude"". Excellent comment, the game doesn't recognise the party as a legitimate party, so I don't even have the option of leaving. Straight up the game just won't let me leave and the only way to get out is to restart Smite.

I have uninstalled, deleted every folder to do with Smite, reinstalled, verified game cache; nothing works.

I appreciate my dead smurf account to keep my company cause playing solo is not all that fun, but I want the option to leave at least like.

TL;DR: Made a smurf, logged in Steam, while using main anything to do with friends will put me into a party with the smurf as the party leader, no way out, lads."

Smite,Healers,"We get the anti heal buffs in 8.3  


However, I think this isnt the right way. In my opinion healers have to much damage for the healing they have.   


Which personally I would think nerfing their damage would be better for them, this way they keep their role as a healer but also dont deal roughly 700 to 800 damage if they go full power midlane, which I also think is their most problematic role.   


Since bruiser solo removes quite alot of threat, damage and scaling from their builds."
Smite,I have GM duel mmr but I’m in masters how does that work?,Do I need to get the 100 tp in masters to be promoted to Gm? Also do I need to end the split with GM or just get to GM for the ranked border?
Smite,[SPOILER] PTS Datamining – 8.3 Bonus Update Skins,"# Info

*This post is intended to be viewed on new reddit and formatted with that in mind.*

The assets for these skins were extracted from the files of the official SMITE PTS client and set up, as well as rendered in blender 2.91 by me.

Please be aware that this is an approximation to how these skins will look in-game. The materials (shaders) are close to impossible to recreate accurately without ever having seen the skin. Also note that I did not attempt to recreate any particle effects.

Smite,False Reporting,"Does Hirez punish people who abuse the report feature? 

I'm curious because I've had two people now accuse me of calling them racial slurs in post game chat trying to get people to report me when all it would take is a simple peek at the chat log and see that not only did I not use any slur, but that I didn't type anything into game chat. 

I've heard of things happening in other games where enough false reports come in and automated systems ban/mute players because of it. Although I don't know if it is people saying that to try and gain sympathy when in fact they did break whatever rule they're claiming they were falsely punished for. 

I know that should the system be working properly I will not be banned, muted, or punished in any way, but I'm still concerned that the system might not work properly and I get punished for it anyway.]

Do people seriously think that making up easily verifiable accusations will get people banned?"
Smite,Is Vamana cangaceiro's voice pack important to the community outside Brazil?," He is a robin wood style thug and he has almost no reference to this, whenever the brazilian community talks about the old dubbing of smite in portuguese we always remember that of vamana, it is voiced by a very famous actor, comedian and voice actor called Tadeu Mello, full of references and comedy, very funny and typical of the Northeast region with an accent and cultural richness. The entire dubbing is iconic but it is difficult to forget this one in specific, I do not think the English dubbing of this skin is very appropriate (not taking the merit of the dubbing). But it would be so incredible for the titan forge team to look at this point, since we only have the dubbing of he-bo which is ... strange. I don't know if it would be very difficult to implement the old voice pack since it was recorded and working.

For the record the rest of my team was 4/6/5, 1/6/5, 3/10/4 and 1/14/6. So my performance was far from the worst but I'm getting reported by half of the team for playing like the rank that i am?"
Smite,SUGGESTION: Stop filling co-op player teams with bots.,"I absolutely loathe how, when you queue up for co-op and there aren't enough players to fill your team, the game fills the open spots with bots. If I queue up to play a medium difficulty co-op match to learn a character without sinking a team in normal with my noobness, it shouldn't feel like I'm playing hard difficulty because I'm having to compensate for the 4 derpy bots on my team who play like they got the Dollar Store AI setups (when the opposing bot team clearly didn't). I'd rather just sit in the damn queue until there's enough people to play. I mean, I won that game, but goddamn. /rant"
Smite,Domination Yellow Damage,"I’m not aware of this is intended or if Hi-Rez is unaware. But domination does not scale with yellow damage. Making it practically useless in a Qin’s Sais, Odysseus’ Bow build. You’re better off going Wind Demon and praying for a crit for the 10% penetration you get or a Titans Bane and using it for the stats and ignoring the passive since those items do scale your yellow damage."
Smite,"Atlas Size, Concern and Speculation","Since adding a lot of giant characters will become a problem, what do you expect from the size of the Atlas? [Arena Gladiator](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_8LcQtllbfY/maxresdefault.jpg)

**Speculation**

If the Devs choose normal or medium size, they can use the '' Kaiju '' ([Ultimate of Hou Yi's T5 skin](https://youtu.be/KPsTVHdGv6Y?t=158)) to represent Atlas' true size as his ultimate. 

Unlike Cthulhu's Ultimate, [The Kaiju](https://i.imgur.com/VILw8Dr.png) is not on the map! So there is no concern with blocked vision or body block. 

**How it could work:** 

Atlas could cast for 3s then his body disappeared, Leaving a mark or statue on the floor (to find out where Atlas would return), then his Titan form appeared on the horizon (just like the Kaiju), something like that. While at this size, his abilities could work just like Cthulhu on the ultimate or just a complete view of the map and a unique ability that affects the entire map. 

 So I would prefer **NORMAL SIZE.**

Smite,Apollos nerf with adc nerfs. Is it enough?,"I'm curious on the general opinion here. Apollo is getting nerf to something that really doesn't matter. The benefit of the ult is the presence not the damage. To me this seems like another moment of hirez nerfing the wrong thing. 

In my opinion, the issue with him is that he has a guardians kit as a hunter. He has more cc in his kit than every hunter, a steroid, a global ult, the highest base power on autos, protections buff. He has everything. 

I have ALWAYS hated this god, even when he was weak. Through increment buffs, he has become top tier yet again and he just needs to be shot down several pegs. Are the hunter nerfs enough? I don't think so.

Remove some cc from his BASE kit. Let his ult have its knockup but lets get rid of the mez hm?"
Smite,Do they even try with matchmaking?,"Honest question, I’ve solo queued 7 games today and i have gone up against four 5 stacks and three of those times my entire team was nothing but solos, correct me if i’m mistaken but isn’t this game supposed to be matching up parties of similar sizes?

edit: it’s really not just today either, pretty much this whole season i have been getting lopsided games like that"
Smite,Suggestion to split Announcer Volume into Announcer Volume and God Volume in Audio Settings,"Frequently  the quiet voice packs of some gods are simply lost against the background of loud and sometimes intrusive anouncer packs and a musical theme can also be added to the general noise, which sometimes extremely drowns out the voice of the god. The saddest thing is that the volume of God's phrases is regulated along with the volume of the commentator, that is, by decreasing the volume of the commentator, the player immediately decreasing the volume of the God's phrases. It would be wonderful to split Announcer Volume into Announcer Volume and God Volume in Audio Settings, taking into account the already existing Music Volume this will allow each player to customize the overall sound picture for themselves. For example, I would gladly make the loudest voice of God and his phrases, in second place I would make music and the quietest component I would make a announcer pack."
Smite,T5 chaac,How much are tier 5 skins normally? I’m just getting back into smite and I want to buy this skin but I’m wondering about how much gems it costs
Smite,They need to give Merlin and Tiamat the same treatment they gave Hel and Cu Chulainn.,"By that I mean they need to allow people to see the stats for all forms of their abilities.

Cu Chulainn and Hel have the stats listed for both forms of their abilities, Normal vs Enraged and Light vs Dark respectively.

But Merlin and Tiamat don't. There's no way to look at the different forms of their abilities without being in game and changing forms."
Smite,Things of interest in the lore for Talons of Tyranny,"\- The Egyptian pantheon has unanimously agreed that Tiamat is evil, due to the whole fact that Egyptians are very much against chaos, as their culture was about order. Seeing that Tiamat is a goddess of chaos, it's no wonder that they've rallied against her. Also, this wasn't mentioned, but I believe that Neith also helped in convincing the other Egyptians to band against Tiamat. This is because Neith is actually a primordial, the ""first of the goddesses"" that also arose out of primordial water. Seeing that a literal goddess who originated from the same waters that Tiamat had emerged from who also doesn't know who she is would be pretty concerning. 

\- Arthur and Merlin were defending the lands of the Celtic pantheon while Olorun and the other gods were fighting Cthulhu is pretty neat, as even though they are technically from a different pantheon, Arthurian myth has roots in Celtic myth, so it wouldn't be that big of a surprise that Merlin and Arthur would go there. Also, it helps to hint that Morgan Le Fay is coming, as she is also from the Arthurian pantheon and she has been hinted at.

\- Persephone's friendship with Mulan is honestly really heartwarming. I'm glad that the writers have stuck with developing her character. It's paid off big time. Also, Mulan's growth as a character when confronted with becoming a god is also nice to see. 

\- Seeing the pantheons being split on Tiamat is interesting and great to see. Both sides present good arguments as to why they are against or with her, and Olorun, being the best dude that he is, is taking everyone's concern into consideration and listening to everyone.

\- Jormungandr is still out there. While not named, it is mentioned that Jorm is still out there and abroad, and even though Hera and the others have tried to capture him, it's of no use, and Arthur seems even more disheartened. I personally think that sooner or later, Arthur might snap, since again, the main reason for the death of his wife, his son, and his kingdom is still out there, roaming around. To add to the stress, Arthur is quite literally a foreigner to this world. Everything he knew from where he came from is either not there or it appears differently, and even though he has fought to protect the world, you have to think; will there ever be peace? If more and more destructive forces reawaken, then it may seem like just a never-ending battle. The gods may keep up with their foes, but Arthur is still human. Those things take tolls.

\- Can't wait for Olorun to have dinner with tall mommy dragon. What would they talk about, I wonder?"

Smite,Question about viewer points,"I was wondering if anyone else is having problems receiving viewer points or if Hi-Rez has said anything about them in general.   


I've claimed a shitload of them and haven't received any on my end that isn't from the battle pass.

Smite,Me and my friend can’t see each other?,"Both me and my friend play on playstation and for someone we can’t see each other. We can see all our other friends that are online and they can see us. But for some reason me and my one friend are unable to see each other even when I search for him by name I can’t find him.


The only time we can see each other is when a third person invites both of us. Does anyone know a fix to this because when it’s just us two we can’t play together because of this"
Smite,Why does everyone have a hate boner for support?,"Anytime someone in my game gets support, they spam ""I'd like to play___"" and ask for any other role, then if they don't get it, they play weird jank like anubis support or morrigan support and lose.

Like what's the thought process behind this? I think support is fun, especially peeling"
Smite,Sobek Rework,So what happens now to sobek existing skins I haven't seen them after the rework anywhere any idea?
Smite,I'm about to transition into level 30,"So I'm about to hit level 30 and I need help about (rotations, enemy gods, builds, and fucking anubis) any information will help."
Smite,how do you rotate and level up quickly as a mid player?,i went into my second ranked match as a mid after spending all day looking up guides and stuff about ranked conquest and even watching some a streamer but then i went into my 2nd ranked match and i was falling very behind in the leveling up department i was level 14 and all my team was level 20 by that point so my question is what is the best way to level up and rotate as a mid player
Smite,Chaac,So I've been playing for a year and always seen how much the community trashes on Chaac. Ive never used him but in paper he seems ok could someone explain me why is he considered a shit tier god?
Smite,How long does it take for tp decay to demote you a ranked division?,"I know that tp decay starts at 2 weeks and you lose 2 tp everyday, but does anyone know how long it takes for you to go down a division? Currently I’m plat 5 sitting at 2/100 tp. There’s only 16 days left in the split so if I stop playing would I get put down into gold 1?"
Smite,Stop Annoying Sounds while waiting in Library,Is there a way to turn off the audio of gods grunting while you're waiting in lobby for a match? This is just really obnoxious/
Smite,Smite Removing Animations After Remodels (And On New Gods),"EDIT: Originally in my post I mentioned Sobek as missing animations, but that was false information. He still has the same amount of animations as far as we can tell. So my apologies for acting hastily.

A few of the remodels they've done seem to be missing animations, namely Isis. Isis looks super stiff now and had her amazing wing stretch/elongate animations removed for seemingly no reason? It just makes them more boring to look at and I just don’t understand why this has been happening for almost 3 years now. 

They’ve done this with Gods starting with Merlin too giving them far less animations such as them having strict in combat animations only and keeping that stance even after leaving.

If we could get the amount of work put back into gods as much as they did for DISCORDIA who has something completely different and wild no matter which direction she is moving then imagine the personality the characters would ooze again."
Smite,Relearning the game,Hi i used to play this game quite a bit and stopped recently league has been annoying me so wanted to play this as a break. What is the best jungle clear i really enjoy pele and I'm looking for videos on her that will help. Just looking for basic information I don't plan on playing too long but I want enough information to not ruin someones game by playing bad
Smite,Colourblind modes,"So we all know these exist and also people that have a colourblindness exist.  


However I have a more unique problem and that is that the 2 colourblind modes I would need to use to enjoy smite to the fulles aka, tritanopia and deutranopia. Since I have troubles seeing green, blue and yellow colours.   


Strongly mess with me, which means if I use one of these some abilities and autos became invisible for me. Yes I can also play without the colour correction, this makes the problem with some skillshots non existent however than I have the problem with not being able to see the health bar of enemy clearly.  


So my question is if we could get the chance to, change the colours of health bars and so on our own to find the best colours possible for ourselves, yes I know the number of people that cant see or distinguish  multiple colours are rare but it would help me quite alot to enjoy the game much more.  


Since I kinda dislike playing arachne and not being able to see the spider web placement often, or even the line indicator of skills when I use quick cast.   


Yes most of this also has to do for me with camera angle terrain and all but I would really love to be able to choose what colours I could see the best for indicators."
Smite,Changing Steam Account Link?,"Hi! My SO has recently gotten very into smite and has been using my Steam account to play. I'd like to unlink my Smite account from my console and she wants to link hers to her brand new Steam account. How would we go about that? I know how to link and unlink, but I don't know how to link her Smite progression on my Steam account to hers, and then link my console progression to my Steam account."
Smite,so this happened,https://streamable.com/3yfc6o not sure if this is technically allowed but here ya go
Smite,Best Assassins for support role?,Just curious.
Smite,"HiRez, if you can't balance healers, just remove/rework AOE heals.","I'm so tired of this back and forth with healers. I have literally never seen ANY game struggle to balance healers like Smite. This infinite back and forth between buffing healers to make them viable, then gutting them when they're played needs to stop. At this point, it's actually REALLY sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

With just items, you can get +150% ADDITIVE anti healing. That's before We also have a relic that has a 45% antihealing AND a 20% damage up penalty if you heal during its effect.  THEN they felt the need to add a 30% anti healing aura if you haven't hit an enemy god in 3s. I could type an entire essay about how awful/lazy the global healing reduction aura is. That's beyond the point. I think it is extremely clear that Hirez can not balance healers in their current state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about this a lot. I play a ton of other games and there are none that struggle this hard with healers. I honestly think the problem with Smite is the amount of easily accessible AOE healing that's in the game. Other games, such as LoL, don't have those super spammable heals that give everyone on their team HP. In fact, League is extremely conservative with who gets AOE healing in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I think at this point, instead of spending the next eternity struggling to balance healers, you just rework them. It's daunting, but at the same time, it will probably be a net positive in the long run to redesign how you approach healing. By going more conservative on who is allowed to heal, how much they heal, and how many get healed at once, you can cut down on a lot of the frustration factor with dealing with healers, while also making people who play these characters not feel like they're on an endless rollercoaster.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you do? Well. You can turn SOME of the heals in the game into shields. Shields are effective HP, but they aren't permanent. There are balance issues wherein you can stack shields on full HP targets to give them a bit more HP than they would normally have, which would have to be balanced with. You can change some heals into something used more preemptively in combat, such as a damage mitigation. Some heals, you can limit how many people can be hit by a heal.   


Here are some examples, numbers are not fine tuned. It is just mostly to show differences between original descriptions and potential changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; INSPIRE (Light Stance) - Hel conjures a burst of light energy around her, healing herself instantly and applying a heal over time to **the two most wounded nearby allies** that ticks every 1s. Hel gains Increased Movement Speed, and allies gain a reduced amount (10%) for the duration.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Light Self Heal: 60/90/120/150/180 (+30% of your Magical Power)   
&gt;  
&gt; Light Heal per Tick: 10/15/20/25/30 (+5% of your Magical Power) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, instead of healing her entire team, she only heals herself and two others. This means that out of combat healing between fights takes MUCH longer, which opens some more counterplay. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, you can make her 1 heal less, and/or make it scale up in healing with lower HP, allowing skill expression from good Hel's getting clutch 1's. At base have it heal significantly less, then around the same or slightly more as they get into sub 10% hp range. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Chang'e twirls, scattering flowers around her, and **Shielding** herself and all nearby allies and damaging nearby enemies. Moonflower Dance also reduces the healing of all nearby enemies.   
&gt;  
&gt; Shielding: 50/70/90/110/130 (20% of your Magical Power) 

Hey, now Chang'e can't do that pesky out of combat healing. Now her team actually needs to back if they get low. Shielding being accessible to her team though means that it is less likely that they need to, as the damage reduced during the fight through shielding would be impactful. This probably would need to come with a damage buff somewhere in her kit, and some fine tuning on numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Ra summons a pillar of blessed light that persists for 6s. Allies inside the blessing have increased Protections and Power and **have their damage taken reduced**. Enemies are damaged every second.   
&gt;  
&gt; Protections: 8/11/14/17/20   
&gt;  
&gt; Physical Power: 8/11/14/17/20   
&gt;  
&gt; Magical Power: 14/18/22/26/30   
&gt;  
&gt;Ally damage reduction:7.5%

The mitigation number here was just off the top of my head. Maybe it needs to be higher, maybe it should be lower. You can use this kind of ability offensively to give your tanky characters extra damage reduction, defensively to give yourself a zone where you take a LOT less damage. It still has the disadvantage of putting you at risk from standing in a small area, especially with allies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Doing things like this across the board will have a net positive impact on the game. Limit how much characters can heal, limit who they can heal. Aphrodite is neat because she only heals herself and one person. (Sometimes it is too much, to be fair), but not being able to heal the entire team for 400-500 over and over helps deal with out of combat healing significantly. Also, changing some abilities to be like Baron's heal, where you actually have to hit enemies to heal, would be fantastic."
Smite,how long did it take you to learn builds when you were starting out?,i ask because i am level 31 and i am trying to learn builds and i want to know how long it took some good smite players to learn builds when they started out
Smite,Guan Yu cooldowns,Ok Hi-rez it's bout time we did something about his cool downs. The dude can literally can ult 3-4 times in an extended teamfights late game. They need to increase his ult cool down and they need to take away the cool down reduction from the 1 or 2.
Smite,"Is there any info about not getting progress towards ranked win milestones such as victory chests, gems, skins and borders.",I know for sure they said they were counting. Mine like everyone's says 0 and I know I did not get the victory chest after 15 wins like I should have.
Smite,GM Duel youtube content,"I am currently in grandmasters duel, making content of competitive PC duel games! I've recently hit 3k MMR in duel. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGAXj9nk-zS4c69g2ISTwg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGAXj9nk-zS4c69g2ISTwg)"
Smite,Which god should be remodel?,Which god should be remodel other than Hun Batz and Cupid?
Smite,It Would be cool if there were some more demons in the game,"When i first downloaded smite, I was expecting the japanese have Some sort of oni characters but apparently no. So it Would be cool if something like a daitengu came into the game
What do you guys think?"
Smite,GM duel players really are different,"Their temperaments are something else but their mechanics are on point

So I get into a ranked game at 1543 mmr gold 4 on console and he gets assigned mid and requests to trade for carry, but our carry locked in Izanami and refused to swap so he goes on to pick Thoth. On the loading screen, we all see GM duel frame from last season and 3 stars.

To be honest our jungle was kinda troll because as I was the solo laner, he started blue with me so I had a slight XP deficit, but because I was playing Nike and quickly cleared wave and didn't really fall behind by pushing the minions under tower. But in the time he spent making his way back to speed, Thoth is immediately first blooded by the enemy Awilix. 

He goes on to int 6 more times and continues to int until he is 3-12 by 24 minutes. Our duo lane also gets outpressured and double killed by fed Awilix till the point that both our support and jungle began a shit talk storm and Thoth responds by challenging everybody to a 1v1.

The enemy team was able to take middle phoenix by 18 minutes but we managed to defend. Izanami split pushed left phoenix and we botched a fire giant steal, but we still somehow managed to win after Thoth pummeled their carries from range and we focused down the Awilix.

In the end, Thoth went 16-16, which is an absolute miracle given he admitted to intentionally feeding the first twenty minutes, and constantly arguing with our jungle and support."
Smite,Jump in or stay out 2021? And other question before jump in,"I like mobas, but given dota 2 is insanely toxic, my Lol account got hacked and won't pay to transfer shard, I wanted to play something similar.

Smite feels fun as a side game and my first few matches weren't even toxic.

Theres both battle passes and season passes which confuses me. What's the difference here?

Is the game healthy and alive, or is it somehow on life support? I don't hear a lot about it.

Also,can you unlock stuff like skins for free or does everything cost money?"
Smite,Okami Tiamat Skin Concept,"&amp;#x200B;

[While I was playing Tiamat for the first time, I realized she needed some cool, primal feeling skin. So... Wolf.](https://preview.redd.it/h3g65cjxlbl61.png?width=4936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d0fae3f0162b383dd885b622b13683e596bc4c)"
Smite,What build would you guys recommend for Pele in arena?,"I tried out glass canon builds and I ended up dying as often as I killed. Against skilled players or players with lots of CC, I just ended up feeding. I did a lot better when I built tankier. So I'm guessing that's the way to go. Here's my current go-to build:

Shifter's shield

Warrior tabi

Talisman of Energy

Berserker's shield

Pridwen

Heartseeker

I know shifter's shield is recommended these days. But I'm guessing the rest of my build needs work. I need to fit anti-heal in there somewhere. Maybe replace Pridwen with Brawler's Beatstick?

Also, I don't use instant cast and I am not good at auto attack cancelling so I don't build Hydra's Lament.

My play style is to press 3, run in, frantically cast 1+2, hope I hit something while spamming auto attacks, and then run away if I haven't already been hit with CC or killed. If my ult is up, I will engage low health squishies with my ult, though I have found it to be pretty useful in escaping tricky situations too.

I really wanna be better with Pele because I'll soon be reaching her free skin in the battle pass. This is how I got into Athena too. I got her skin in one of the previous battle passes and I tried her out and had fun."
Smite,Smite/Hirez’s continued allowance of racial slurs in game,"Every day people are sharing into Smites Facebook pages screenshots of the slurs, depredations, threats and otherwise that are ALLOWED to propagate through smite in game communications.

Bans exist if you can report someone and that report makes it to the right channel, maybe.

But it really just begs to question, when simple text moderation has been available for decades in the video game world... why the fuck are asshats still able to type in ‘stfu n*****’ (obv without the stars) and similar easily catchable phrases that could AUTOMATICALLY BE BLURRED.

That person could IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY be banned and removed for their language, but instead the harassed have to work to ensure they aren’t harassed, rather than smite actually being a responsible company rather than one run by kids.

Take any MMO in existence, ANY game with chat functions, what I’m discussing is not an extra feature, it’s a bare minimum tooo to prevent harassment and discourage bigotry within your platform.

I’m just frankly sick of seeing kind people being harassed by bigots using Smite as their tool, chasing away people whom might otherwise enjoy the game.

It’s just unacceptable."
Smite,The death toll build has made solo lane fun again,Solo lane is effecting the outcome of the game like never before right now with it. Being able to go into a fight late game and stick to the backline with berserkers/frostbound is so fun. Even on gods like Achilles or cu chu that you would typically never build for AA have a lot of success with the build. I know the item is strong and going to get nerfs. But damn it's fun.
Smite,Why did you quit Smite before or now?,I considered quitting and tried other games cause Loki Rework was too awful. I still love SMITE and I'm decent at it so quitting it would be like quitting a good job just cause you stay late now.
Smite,Noises Upon Clicking,"There's this new thing (unless I've just literally never noticed it) that when in the main menu or god builder, there will be this sword clashing-type noise that plays when you click on most anything. It's ultra annoying, does anyone know how to get rid of it?"
Smite,Loki,Why do they keep buffing the scaling on the 3 instead of making it slightly faster. It will still be less bursty than his old aimed strike but it will actually give you a reason to channel it. Right now it feels like its better to just cancel it late game for quicker burst as it takes way too long to get the damage off.

Smite,Gods under multiple pantheons,"This has probably been thought of before, but if this were allowed, then the duality of the Greek and Roman gods could be emphasized. There are also many gods in the Hindu and Chinese mythology that cross over as well, for example if Hirez ever wanted to add the Buddha to smite."
Smite,My experience in playing Tiamat for over 90 games,"Hello everyone I am making this post for anyone that loves conquest and really loves Tiamat or is interested in to her.

First, I will start with my actual experience on Tiamat I am sitting on 2700 worshipers 50 wins, and 39 losses. I am doing this post for sharing my thoughts on how to play her in the Mid lane mindset. let's start

After many hours of experimentation and many differents start ( for conquest) I have been to the conclusion that start with conduit gem + first-tier boots + mana chalice is the best option in a NONE pro-environment. I suggest MANA CHALICE  because since I started playing her I keep using a lot of abilities either for clearing or for poking making plays following ganks all that from LVL 2-8 and without mana chalice I would off been unable to fight them. Just for a little math moment at LVL 5 with conduit boots and mana chalice ( no back ) if I use my full combo with ult mage 3 I am ending at 159 mana this is ridiculously low for a stance switcher using is full combo how you expect me to switch back and clear or poke impossible. I really suggest you guys people that wanna learn her and have fun with her try to go Mana chalice rush shoes of focus Chronos pendant and soul gem with this you are at 40% cdr + Chronos passive = you can already have Tiamat 4-1 around 19 seconds cooldowns going back up 1 lane you can put 2 minions pools and just go back to a team fighting. I suggest you go with anti heal or spear of deso/rod of tahuti next depends on the enemy team and how many kills per mins there's in your match if low I have a tendency to go rod if high kill per mins I go spear for good use of the passive. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main suggestion with Tiamat is LIMIT TESTING don't ever be afraid to use her stance switch even early on this can lead to good plays if you have a jungler that can go in aggressively I have already did solo kills at LVL 2 under enemy tower getting out with aegis if I poke them a bit before... 

Anyway she is an awsome goddess that is hard to play and master and i am looking foward the pro's with her i just really hope she wont get the merlin/tiamat/presephone threatement because of pro games"
Smite,[LORE] Talons of Tyranny – Diplomacy," *Taken from the official PTS client – Version 8.3*

# Diplomacy

The moon rose over the Taihang Mountains, and the dead murmured contentedly in their graves. Mulan walked among them, listening to their stories. When she heard the soft hiss of blooming flowers, she stopped and turned. “Hello my friend.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Mulan,” Persephone said, stepping out of the trees. “I am glad to see you.”

&amp;#x200B;

“As I am glad to see you.” Mulan embraced her friend, and together they sat, listening to the night birds call to one another. “Hades has reopened the gates of the underworld?” Mulan asked, after several moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

“He has.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Then he believes the threat is ended?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Isn’t it?” Persephone inhaled deeply, as if tasting the air. “I can no longer smell that creature’s taint on the wind. What of your own lands?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Better than they were. The corrupted jade has been…cleansed. And Cthulhu’s madness has faded from the minds of the other gods…” Mulan paused. Persephone was smiling. “What?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Other gods,” Persephone repeated. She plucked a white flower from one of the grave markers and held it up. “The mantle of divinity rests more easily on your shoulders these days.” The flower sprouted thorny tendrils of green that coiled lovingly about her wrist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mulan studied her hands. Still calloused, despite her ascension. Perhaps they always would be. “I have…come to terms with it. With myself.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“That is good to hear.” Persephone looked at her. “Will you go to Olympus?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Will you?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I will not be welcome there for some time, I think,” Persephone said, leaning back. “Even so, I am curious as to the new arrival.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Tiamat,” Mulan said. The wind had carried her name across China. The saviour of the world, whose return had seen the banishment of Cthulhu. She did not know what to make of the dragon. Nor did the other members of her pantheon, come to that. Some thought her a potential ally, others thought her as dangerous as Cthulhu. “What do you make of her?”

&amp;#x200B;

“She is powerful I know that much.”

&amp;#x200B;

“She is the one who cleansed China of the jade.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“She did the same for the rest of the world as well – and more than just the world. Asgard has been restored and Yggdrasill. It is as if none of it ever happened.”

&amp;#x200B;

“You must find that a relief.” Mulan paused. The dead had fallen silent – as if awaiting something. She glanced at Persephone, and saw that the other goddess had stiffened in alarm. “What is it?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Do you hear that?”

&amp;#x200B;

Mulan did. A faint, irregular creaking that grew louder with every passing moment. Suddenly, a raucous chorus of blackbirds burst from the trees and rose into the night sky. Then, a heavy, awkward shape erupted into view at the edge of the graveyard. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Is that -?” Mulan began, staring at the apparition. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Baba Yaga,” Persephone growled, rising to her feet. 

&amp;#x200B;

“The very same,” came a familiar voice from behind them. They whirled to find the old witch crouched amid the grave markers, surrounded by a bevy of floating skulls. As they watched, she uprooted another and set it to hang in the air beside its fellows. “Don’t mind me. Just collecting on old debt.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What are you doing here, witch?” Persephone demanded. 

&amp;#x200B;

“As I said, collecting on a debt. I am owed many favours, by many beings, alive and dead, mortal and divine.” Baba Yaga’s gaze fixed on them. “Come to think of it, don’t you two still owe me favours?”

&amp;#x200B;

“We paid our debt to you,” Mulan said. Her hand fell to her sword hilt. The old witch was dangerous, though in ways she did not quite understand. Even fierce Guan-Yu stepped lightly around Baba Yaga. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Much good as it did us,” Persephone said. 

&amp;#x200B;

Baba Yaga chuckled. “You have a complaint about my services, Queen of the Underworld?”

&amp;#x200B;

Persephone glared at her. “Your prophecy was wrong. The dark sea was thrown back – Cthulhu was defeated! But not by anything we did.”

&amp;#x200B;

Baba Yaga cackled. “And what makes you think I was referring to him, the great blubbery nightmare? Oh he was bad, to be sure – a doom that might have eaten the world. But he wasn’t the one I was worried about. Nor was he the one I warned you of.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“What?” Mulan glanced at Persephone. “We thought -”

&amp;#x200B;

“Is it my business what you thought?” Baba Yaga gestured and the skulls danced in the air about her for a moment, before resolutely swooping off towards her chicken-legged hut. “You think Cthulhu was the sea? Ha! If that was so, why would the waters have bound him? No, the sea has swallowed him up – and it threatens to do the same to all of us as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What sea?” Persephone asked.  

&amp;#x200B;

“The sea, girl. The first sea, that filled the abyss – the sea that birthed this world and all that walks or crawls upon it.” Baba Yaga leered at them. “The sea that she rose from, before any other, the Glistening One, in all her glory.”

&amp;#x200B;

Persephone grimaced. “Stop spouting cryptic nonsense and put it plainly for once in your misbegotten existence.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Tiamat,” Mulan said, softly. “She is talking about Tiamat.”

&amp;#x200B;

\*

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun stood amid a garden of wilting greenery, studying the distant mountain and the immense ziggurat at its summit. The shadow of the newborn mountain shrouded much of Olympus and many of its gardens were suffering as a result. It was a small matter – the gardens could be reawakened at a touch from one or more of the gods now gathered in Olympus. But it irked him nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

He heard someone step onto the balcony behind him. “Looking at the stars, Olorun?” Yemoja asked. Olorun turned. 

&amp;#x200B;

“As if I could see them with that thing in the way,” he said. Tiamat’s mountain blocked the moon and the stars as well as the sun. Yemoja frowned. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I asked the rivers about her. Our new neighbour.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun paused. “And what did they say?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Nothing.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun’s eyes narrowed. “They did not know of her?” If Tiamat were as old as she claimed, it seemed impossible that the rivers would not know something. 

&amp;#x200B;

“No.” Yemoja looked away. “They refused to speak of her.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun was momentarily taken aback. “I have never known the rivers to refuse you anything,” he said, choosing his words with care. 

&amp;#x200B;

“They never have – until now.” She looked past him, at Tiamat’s temple. “They are afraid, Olorun. And they are not the only ones.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Have they arrived then?” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Some. Not all. But some. Come. They are waiting in the meeting chamber.”

&amp;#x200B;

When they arrived in the meeting chamber, an argument was already in progress. Heimdallr, representative for the Aesir, sat with his arms crossed and a stoic expression on his face as Sobek, crocodile-headed god of the Nile, loomed over him. “And I say you are a fool, Aesir,” Sobek growled. “She is no benefactress, but a predator circling us.”

&amp;#x200B;

“The Aesir have no complaint against this new goddess,” Heimdallr said. “She has restored Asgard to its former glory. Whether she intended to do so or not is of no importance. The deed was done and the Allfather has decreed we treat it as the gift it was.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sobek snarled wordlessly and turned as Olorun and Yemoja entered the chamber. “Surely you must see sense,” he said. “Tiamat cannot be trusted.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Set evidently disagreed,” Zeus put in, from where he sat. “It was by his cunning that she was awakened, after all.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sobek grunted. “Set is a vainglorious fool, and he always has been. That he thought it best to awaken this creature is a sure sign that it will have dire consequences for us all.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Whatever his intentions, the deed has been done,” Olorun said, as he took his place at the head of the table. He looked at the gathered gods – representatives from all of the major pantheons. Fewer than he’d hoped, but more than he’d expected – especially after recent events. Enough, perhaps, to achieve some form of consensus on the matter facing them. Though, given what he’d seen to date, perhaps that was a vain hope. “The question is, what is to be done about it?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I am all for knocking that oversized rock pile down,” Zeus said, grinning fiercely. “Can’t have it casting its shadow over Olympus forever, after all.” He looked at Hera, but she did not return his smile. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I believe Tiamat has earned a moment’s grace, at least,” she said. Zeus’ smile became a scowl and he looked away. Olorun knew that like their leaders, the Olympians were divided on the matter. So were most of the other pantheons. 

&amp;#x200B;

“As does Odin,” Heimdallr said. Asgard’s restoration had gone a long way towards garnering Tiamat allies among the Aesir, Olorun judged. Or, if not allies then peaceful neighbours, at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

“She is dangerous,” Sobek said. “More dangerous than any being we have ever faced. Better to destroy her now, before she destroys us.”

&amp;#x200B;

“And is that Horus’ opinion – or yours, Master of the Nile?” Hera asked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sobek bowed his head. “I speak for Horus in this – and the rest. The Egyptian pantheon stands united in this, if nothing else.”

&amp;#x200B;

“All save Set, of course,” Olorun said, stroking his chin. “Where is he, by the way?”

&amp;#x200B;

Sobek scratched at his neck with a talon. “Vanished. Horus barely managed to escape the collapse of Tiamat’s temple. We assume Set and his cronies must have done so as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Loki has yet to return to Asgard,” Heimdallr put in. “I have sought for any sign of him, but he has gone to ground – possibly in one of the other realms.” He shrugged. “Perhaps Bellona and the others are with him.”

&amp;#x200B;

“They must be found,” Ares spoke up, startling everyone present. The god of war had spoken little since his return to Olympus. “They may know something of this creature – some knowledge that could be of use to us in the future.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun gave him a sharp look. Ares spoke as if he were already planning for the worst. Then, given his nature, perhaps that was to be expected. Olorun took some comfort in that. He’d had his doubts about Ares when Hera had first suggested eliciting his aid. But the war-god had more than proven his mettle in the struggle against Cthulhu. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Set and the others are not important,” Chaac rumbled. The Maya god of the storm rose from his seat. “Tiamat is all that should concern us. Kukulkan advises patience and wariness – I say let us see what she plans before we make any rash decisions.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun’s eyes scanned the assembled gods. Most were nodding in agreement with Chaac. Others, from their expressions, seemed to prefer Zeus’ suggestion. He paused as his gaze came to rest on the noble features of Arthur, king of a forgotten kingdom and defender of Avalon. During Cthulhu’s rampage, Arthur and Merlin had done what they could to defend the innocent souls of the Celtic lands – a heroic, if doomed effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun thought of Mulan – another newly-ascended mortal – and felt a flicker of sympathy for the tribulations Arthur had undergone. He’d had his own dragon to fight – one that was still abroad in the world, despite the best efforts of Hera and the others. He cleared his throat. “What do you think, Arthur?”

&amp;#x200B;

Arthur was silent for a moment. Then, his hands found the sheathed form of Excalibur laying on the table before him and he said, “Dragons lie. They poison the very air with their untruths. Though their scales shine, they are things of darkness.” He met Olorun’s gaze squarely. “I think you would be a fool to trust such a creature, whatever it claims.”

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun sat back. The pantheons were, as he’d expected, divided on the matter. “The truth is we know nothing about her,” he said, after several moments. “She is older than most of you, and unknown to me. If she is a friend, that is unfortunate. If she is an enemy, that is dangerous. So we must learn all we can, however we can.” He paused, considering his next words carefully. “That is why I have already sent several of our number to seek out those who might possess some knowledge of her, even as I take a more direct approach.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What do you mean?” Hera asked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Olorun rose. “She invited us to visit her. So that is what I am going to do.”"
Smite,What stops fenrirs attack where he jumps on you three times?,I’ve been playing mostly tyr in solo since I started a few weeks ago. I just encountered a fenrir and I couldn’t stop his jump attack. He killed me so many times. Do any of tyr’s abilities stop it?
Smite,What are we doing wrong?,"Me and my friend are trying to play conquest and are defending/attacking left lane but our team wants us to help them at middle, so we go middle and then they go left lane, die, and say that we are bad and report us. What the heck are we supposed to do??"
Smite,Need some Smite advice for solo lane please!,"Hi  - as the title states I need some help. Sorry for any bad english as well!  


I play smite occassionally, and I am fairly high level account. 130. But I have never been good at solo lane. Well, or the game really. I am a casual player. But I only want to get good for one reason, and its just to have fun playing it. If I am not good enough, my team just explains that I ruin it, so I have to be better or quit the game really. So thats what I do I suppose.  


I am okay at the game, I mostly play mages and do the best with that. But I want to play warriors as well. Only thing is, is that it just seems like I only fight King Arthur. I wish I had saved screenshot, but I have only fought them when I queue. I cannot ban, since I am too worthless to play ranks.  


Nobody beats him that I have tried, and it may be due to how bad I am, but I can win against other warriors. I have done it before. The only time I have come close to winning is if I also play King Arthur. But I was not a fan of him, and I prefer to play other things.   


Is there a way for me to win? Or is the only solo pick I should play King Arthur? I usually just let my team down and I usually think I am not worth going solo. I just need some advice to learn how to do anything against him, and maybe some tips to get better! I have watched so many youtube videos, and I play like them as much as I can, but part of me thinks that the game has changes so much since I used to play that the game has outgrown me, and I'm not meant for it now."
Smite,Thoughts?,"I was wondering if there was any competitive community leagues for smite(console).
I’ve been playing smite for over 2 Years now and it makes me sad that we don’t have a large community to do tournaments and stuff. If not should I make a community comp league for smite? Conquest league, joust league, shit maybe even assault league if enough people want it"

Smite,what is a good level to start going into ranked matches?,when you first started out smite how long did you play before going straight into ranked?
Smite,"Who is your main, and why?","I have been a longtime on and off player recently returning in full after the RWBY gang was added to the fold. 

Anyway, this post is just to ask the question! Who do you main and why? 

   If you choose not to stay in one lane then give me your favorite character for each role. Warrior, Assassin, Guardian, and Mage! 

For me my main always switch every few months, but Currently rocking Kali. Something about being stupid and getting rewarded fits my gameplay. As for each role 

Assassin: Kali. See above buuut I’ll add one extra one, Da Ji, **BLEED DAMAGE MUHAHAHA**

Guardian: Yang Xiao Long (Terra) I know she is extremely unfaithful to the series but in general I love Terra or Yang, since I only use that one skin, if I have a team that matches my aggressive play-style then it’s GG! And the puns. They make like Cinder and *fall* but I think there funny

Warrior: Mulan, I’m not a fan of the Disney movies but the bow makes for a great escape leveled up! I... don’t play warrior much.

Mage: Chang’e, A Good balance between Damage and healing, along with her CC removing second ability and there’s nothing between you and your teammate’s health bar!

Edit! I forgot about Hunter even though I have ten reps in Jing Wei... funny how that works. 

Ahem! Hunter: Jing Wei. Same as Kali do dumb and risky stuff and escape. Been playing her since I got her Metal skin."
Smite,Health items.,"Is there an item that does extra damage the more health you have? I swear there is one

Edit: I think I was thinking of Animosity, but if anyone has any other items similar to book of Thoth but for Heath, let me know"
Smite,Glad to see slowdown builds are now dead.,"It's not like there were a handful of gods with dedicated builds for it, and not like the fault of the ""basic attack reliant gods"" **cough** Hunters **cough** for getting hit so easily. Manikin's scepter absolutely needed a nerf, they didn't need to fuck up slowdown mechanics entirely in the process.

Well Bellona being good again was fun while it lasted..."
Smite,Smite character design tier list: Design over the years discussion!,"So I just made a smite character tier list. The tier list is subjective and blah blah blah, still I noticed how Smite has been polishing out character designs each season. Apart from Heimdallr I don't dislike any modern approach to gods, that was curious to say the least because in Lol people are constantly compalining about how designs are getting worse over the years. (Is not because the textures are better, they can look good but be an horrible design keep that in mind)

I would love to hear your opinion on how much have Hi-rez improved in terms of design/concepts, and also hear what would you do to improve ""older"" design. (If Mulan had a Breastplate she could have been S tier because apart from that, and the make-up that makes her look white in her Splah art, she has a perfect design)

[Tiamat is SS tier and Danza sits in S tier](https://preview.redd.it/ja1by8wcael61.jpg?width=1308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d18619a7f86e833fb64dd60f0ba55faf549cc2)"
Smite,Fix ranked ffs,"This shits been broken for like 5 days now and these clowns really haven’t even gotten to the bottom of it yet? 

My guess is, it’s more than simply a visual error displaying TP and division.. and there’s no way that games played over the past week will be backtracked and your ranked stats adjusted. It appears to be a net code error."
Smite,PS4 Blue Screening Since The Last Patch,"Has anyone else's game been pretty much unplayable since the last update and maintenance cycle? Mine's been in steady decline since the start of S8 but I can handle a crash once in a while. Since the last update my game crashes EVERY match though. It's PS4 error ce-34878-0 which is errors with the application or system software I believe. System and app are both the most recent patch, have uninstalled and reinstalled and changed where my game is installed (system vs external) with no luck. I know this one's not Hi-Rez's fault as it's not a server issue or anything, I'm just curious if anyone else is getting this particular error and if so is there anything you're doing that's fixed it?

Only things I can seem to find that might work now are initializing my console which I don't really wanna do cos it's the only game it's happening on, or trying to find a new console outright. Sucks cos S8 is actually pretty fun and I can't play at all atm, even solo bot games."
Smite,Hun Batz is terrible,His entire kit revolves around an ult that brings nothing to teamfights.
Smite,Alternative Mage Starters,"Lots of people have been saying that Sundering Axe and Tainted Breastplate are going to be the new meta for mid lane starters. I’m gonna propose a couple of a other suggestions for fun.

Spartan Flag: this has 65 power but has no downtime in the passive if you’re relatively stationary as mid. It gives 10% extra power. If you’d have around 600 power when you build this late game, it would get 60 extra power from passive. This, along with 300 hp and a passive for allies seems usable to me. A god like Hel benefits best from this.

Manikin Hidden Blade: Sundering axe steals 10% of HP every 10 sec, manikin does 15% every 5 sec if you’ve been out of combat. The kicker is that you need to have downtime from the fight and it also has no power like sundering. Also, it’s physical damage so your pen as a mage doesn’t work for it.

I don’t really think either of these will be meta but i think they could be surprisingly good if tried out."
Smite,Genuinely how are you supposed to rank up in conquest?,It’s kind of unbelievable how often throw in ranked games. I’ve been at 1600mmr and a straight fall down to 1200. No wins in between just loss after loss after loss. I hate to be the person to say it’s never my fault but 6/7 of my last games i’ve had 0 deaths in the first 5 minutes and within the first 5 someone starts throwing just for fun. Or even just throwing before the game starts with fun things like Kuzenbo Jungle or Yemoja mid or Zeus support.  There’s actually nothing I can do to ensure that none of my teammates INTENTIONALLY THROW the entire game. Obviously smite isn’t like other games where you can single handedly 1v5 a team. I just don’t understand how it’s fun for people to load into smite just to be an absolute baby. I honestly don’t know how I’m supposed to rank up with this sort of thing happening every single time I play. It gets to the point where I know exactly how the game is going to go before the game starts. First game on today I look up our kuku mid and he has a .88 KDA and a .41 KD. Literally would have done better with no mid at all instead of someone that just feeds. I am genuinely asking for help I don’t know what to do.
Smite,Where do people learn about the duel meta? And how to climb the duel ladder?,"Hello,

It seem like everyone know about the duel meta, but I.

Where do they learn about it?

I'm also looking for some tips from more experience duel players. Thank you :)"
Smite,How can you counter full guardian/warrior teams?,"I literally entered the game and got three games consecutively against full guardian teams, got destroyed and got very frustrated. How can you counter full guardian or warrior teams? It is always a struggle and it bothers me that it works. Like why would you need other roles then?"

Smite,Ar-tyr &amp; Arthur,"So we have a King Arthur skin for Tyr. It's based off the movies and stories moreso then what we have in smite, but it's okay.

So why not have a Tyr skin for King Arthur? I don't have a pun for the name, but still. His missing hand that's the wolf part? It can hold the sword in its mouth. His sword can look like Tyr's, and it'd be like a cosplay of Tyr. If there are any artist who wants to model that go ahead."
Smite,HIREZ- RANKED TP AND MMR IS NOT FIXED...,"In the trello they posted, 2 hours ago they’ve claimed the issue with ranked is fixed in the live client.. it’s even worse.

It’s ‘fixed’ in that it’s showing your division and MMR, but ranked wins aren’t even giving TP or MMR anymore, some of my friends are saying the ranked games isn’t even coming up in their match history now, and in the post game lobby where TP/MMR is awarded its completely blank. Nor have any of the ranked games in the previous 5 days been added to your Wins/Losses, or the Tribute Points given..

Do these guys even play their own game at any point? It takes 30 seconds for someone to login to the live client and see this."
Smite,Someone please explain this to me,"Almost 50 minute match and we won, with kuz jng and geb mid, almost 50 minutes XD

Smite,What God do you think is strongest when mastered ?,What God do you think would have the biggest payout for mastering them?
Smite,I work nights. I can't fucking play ever.,I get home at 7am EST and usually get on smite after like an hour. This is at least the third time this week that I've gotten on and played less than two games before random maintenance happens. This time right in the middle of a ranked game. PLEASE GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER HI REZ I JUST WANT TO PLAY YOUR GAME!
Smite,Priority points,"So I need to bitch about the priority points for a second. As a concept I love them it's a great idea to deal with people wanting the same roles.
Recently I had discovered that if you have priority points, get into a lobby and get your role. Even if the game doesn't go through because someone doesn't pick it still eats your priority points. Which is dumb because I didn't get to play the role I wanted.
But given that logic it stands to reason that if your fill or don't get the role you want that if the same thing happens you would get a priority point. 

Yea no it just pretends you didn't earn it. This inconsistency is annoying.

My suggestion albiet probably difficult to implement is to have priority points taken ONLY if a game lasts 10 minutes. Because nothing is worse than after many games of not getting your role, getting it but half a team DCs and the game ends in 5.  

Or at least have the deciding factor for priority points be at game start.

At the VERY least have gaining priority points and using them be on the same system."
Smite,Mercury help,"He just feels so bad right now. He’s my highest worshipers but I feel like i’m not getting one shot potential anymore. 

My build is Eye, ScS, Ninja Tabi, Arondight, Rage, Wind Demon. Plz help me. What am i missing. Is arondight a mistake on him?"
Smite,New Debuff Idea,"Exactly what the title says.

Imagine a Hel 3 or an Eset 3 ground targeter. Enemies hit by the ability (no damage) have all their buffs/auras removed for a duration. This includes buffs from camps, fire giant, gauntlet of thebes, lotus crown, and ability/personal buffs like Cabrakan passive and Ares' aura. Basically a negative cleanse.

Basically speaking, it removes all the square buffs that appear above your health bar.

Thoughts? Could be on a 1/2/3/4/5 second duration, or something less."
Smite,Late game help,"Me and the boys are pretty good at Conquest but we can get pretty lost 40 minutes in (of the games get that late)and lose a lot of games we shouldn’t, especially since season 8 started. Can anyone help?"
Smite,Does anyone know if the Avatar/Korra skins will be available for purchase?,"Will the battle pass Avatar skins be available for purchase at some point? I know the RWBY skins are available to purchase with gems now, but wasn't sure if it would be the same for the Avatar skins. I'm just hoping to get the Korra one since I missed my chance haha. Thank you!"
Smite,Fail-Not changes,"Recent changes to Fail-Not:

- Decreased Physical Power from 45 to 40

- Decreased Critical Strike Chance from 20% to 10%

- Increased the Critical Strike Chance on marked enemies from 15% to 20%

With this nerf, Fail-Not viability will drop pretty hard. This item is also pretty expensive (2800g) and I get it, it offers pen and cooldown, but the passive is already pretty situational and don't work that well for some Hunters (Anhur, Chiron, Hachiman, Heimdallr, Jing Wei, Rama, Ullr and Xbal).

So, what do you think about this changes?

IMO, they should at least make the price fair, something like 2600g or at least increase the base crit to 15% (reduces base crit by 5% and increase passive crit by 5%).

With the buff for Spectral Armor, there's no point in building crit and HiRez should not implement changes like that."
Smite,Looking for ways to take my gameplay to the next level in Conquest,"So I've been playing the game (almost exclusively conquest since it's the gamemode I enjoy the most) for a good few months now and I'm really enjoying it. I'm coming here asking for ways I could potentially improve (in conquest specifically) I already have a half decent grasp on the very basics like roles and how they work, how to build items, and the beginning bits of how to play okayly. I'm just looking for help on slightly more advanced tactics and aspects of the game. Please and thank you in advance (also the reason I'm not going to YouTube is bc I don't learn well from YouTube for the most part)"
Smite,Mage starters,I’ve been playing Tiamat as a bruiser and my builds are great but I’m not sure which starter I should go. I like conduit gem for the damage but the sand of time cdr is really nice. I feel like your damage lacks with sot. What do you guys think? Is the 20 cdr worth ?
Smite,I can't open the smite window while the game is running,"When I run smite, the game opens and starts to run in the background, but does not automatically open. When I click on the smite icon on the taskbar, the screen switches to black for a moment, as if it is switching to the Smite window, but then goes right back to my desktop. Using the task view or Alt + Tab to switch to Smite causes the game to crash.

&amp;#x200B;

I reinstalled the game today, and it worked the first time I opened it, but after a game crash, I couldn't get back in, and I am now having the exact same problem again.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this an issue that any of you have had or has a known fix? thanks"
Smite,Console player looking to get better.,"I just want to first say I have been playing smite on Xbox since late 2015 ImpetusTruth is my name.  I have taught my wife and step son to become pretty good at the game however I never really feel like I am good enough to grind to masters in conquest by myself. The highest I ever reached was plat 2 last season. 

Of course I play on savage quick cast and instant cast when needed but there are two things that always got me thinking. One my sensitivity speed and two main-ing a role.

I currently keep my sensitivity at 10 which I do so I can be most accurate but there are times I feel like it would be better if I went faster for better juking or melee. Now I know it is best to be fast and accurate but if I had to say which one is best what should I go for when it comes to sensitivity?

I personally find all roles fun but I also have heard that sticking to one role can really make a difference hence pros do it that way. So how do I pick a role to master? Do I go with what I am good at or do I pick what I like or it really doesn't matter because I am not a pro or to main a role is not needed for ranked? 

Sorry this post got long but I hate the feeling of plateauing."
Smite,Death's toll,If i'm fighting against a hunter or assassin that builds deaths toll in duel what's the best way to counter if i'm playing a mage?
Smite,Intentional feeding,"I Just played a game where our jungle was jurmungar and he fead 0-16 my team wouldn't surrender, i'm honestly considering uninstalling. Solo queue in this game is pretty bad.

I wish the game had Phantom levels for each opponent where it would keep track the XP gained from killing specific players so that the xp gained only applies when fighting the player you got it from, this way your team still has a chance if someone decides to intentionally feed.

So the rest of my team doesn't have to fight a level 20 nemesis while the rest of us are at level 13 and 14."
Smite,Voice Chat not working right,"So I'm on PC, rest of friends on xbox or ps4.  One of my buddies on xbox can't hear us in game or lobby screen but we can hear him.  We have tried everything and are out of options."

# ADC Crit builds

&gt; Starter -&gt;  Devourer's -&gt; Ninja Tabi -&gt; Rage -&gt; Executioner -&gt; Wind Demon

Exec after Rage is mandatory unless you snowball hard against potatoes. Tanks and hybrids will laugh at you otherwise, it's not funny when that happens.

If you're getting camped and/or otherwise losing the game and can't afford to get stacks, then go with a Qins build, or risk it with Malice or DB. The problem with Malice is that it's simply worse compared to the competition and IIRC Deathbringer is worse than Rage even at 1 stack.

Either way going crit is questionable after patch, people love to build newly buffed items. It's safe toe xpect every single tryhard solo laner to build Spectral Armor.

tldr: you're doomed

# ADC Qins builds

&gt; Starter -&gt; Devourer's -&gt; Ninja Tabi -&gt; Odysseus -&gt; Qins -&gt; Dominance

And this build is questionable. No pen whatsoever until you get your final item and despite having Qins against tanks your damage is so much lower. Executioner last is poinless with the new starters items, you'll overcap.

Reminding you that buying your 6th item is much more difficult now. In season 7 you'd sell your blessing, now you're paying to upgrade it.

It might be a good idea to replace Odysseus with Executioner, this time you have pen but your damage is way lower, could even go into Dominance last, you have even more pen but your damage against squishies is lowered once more.

Perhaps it could be viable to get Executioner into Qins into Berserker's without overcapping much AS, massive pen against tanks and Qins. 1v1 against a Hunter or Assassin and you friggin' die.

tldr: you're doomed

# I AM A MAGE builds

&gt; Starter -&gt; Transcendence &gt; Ninja Tabi -&gt; Jotunn's -&gt; Crusher -&gt; Dominance

With Leather's Cowl you have a small amount of lifesteal, with Hunter's Cowl you have a massive amount of AS once you reach Level 20, this build's damage is massive but sustain is low and you fall behind as you approach lategame.

You could replace Crusher with Asi, now you have great lifesteal and more Attack Speed but slotting it is difficult. Get it too late and it feels pointless, get it too early and it feels weird to follow it up with a Jotunn's. 

tldr: you're doomed

The Transcendence build rocks but the lack of lifesteal feels terrible so... why not simply use Devourer's instead? \*taps head\* You'll deal less damage but Jotunn's is busted and Crusher is a great item, 20% AS immediately means it's not a bad ADC item, it has a decent amount of power and it has pen, even without abusing the passive it's still free damage.

But the point behind this build is that percentage pen options for hunters absolutely suck right now so you might as well embrace it and focus on flat pen instead. The problem is a bad comparison between Crusher and Odysseus."
Smite,What just happened?,"I just downloaded the game on xbox yesterday. 

Day 1

First couple games: oh man, this is cool. Wow, I did good?

About the third game in normal arena: Oh, these are bots. That's cool. Still doing good. 

Day 2

I hope I get to play real people today.

First normal arena match: Wow, look at all those nifty portrait frames. Oh, damn. I'm bad. 

Second match: I have literally no idea what's going on. And, I'm dead again.

Third match:  Ok, this is just pointless.

I like the game, and I get that a super complex game like this has a learning curve, but seriously, wth? Did I miss a memo somewhere? Am I not supposed to queue in normal arena, which is one of the only game modes open to me? Should I spend my first week in training fighting endless bot matches?"
Smite,Iso teamates with coms.,My boys are outta town this weekend who's trying to play casual? warning not the best mechanics but I know the game well.
Smite,"Hello, new player here","Hi all, I just downloaded the game yesterday!

Still grasping everything, but part of the reason I downloaded the game is because they have Mulan and Sun wukong in it.

Those are my 2 favorite characters in all of legend and want to main them no matter what.

Can anyone give me some tips/advice?  (Those characters or in general) 
Keep in mind I’m new, so may not understand certain game language lol.

Much appreciated!"
Smite,Is the game still alive?,"I'm wondering, just to see if it's worth it to make all of my friends install and it play some matches :)

Smite,Are pendulum of ages and book of thoth viable together?,"In my mind it would make sense on a damage change, Agni, morrigan, etc. 

Does it stack and is it worth it late game?"
Smite,Removing/Changing Cosmetics,"This is an obvious burner. 

So, last June, after allegations, HiRez removed the DM related items from the game, as well as banned his accounts. 2 months ago, Twitch changed the Pogchamp emote, as a result of comments made by the person in the emote, Gootecks.

With these in mind, should HiRez look to re-dub over certain gods/skins? Most notably, Agni, Thanatos for gods, and Retrocles, Poolseidon, and Shonen Spark Mercury. (I feel I'm missing some?)

For those who are not aware, Agni, Thanatos and Poolseidon are voiced by Scott Freeman, who in 2018 was arrested for child... 'materials' and is a registered sex offender to this day. (Which I believe is why the 't-shirt' style e-sports skin for Thana uses the Final Boss model, not the base?)

Retrocles is of course voiced by Kevin Sorbo, who since the events of Jan 6th, has made numerous problematic comments regarding that day, as well as other issues.

Shonen Spark is voiced by Vic Mignogna, who has in recent years lost most newer roles, due to a large number of allegations against him.

 While I understand it's much more work to remove/re-work skins than to remove an avatar or announcer pack, I feel that if you're going to change some things for a specific reasons, other items that are affected in the same way should also be changed to match."
Smite,Smite League - Europe - Thursday 8PM UTC,"Smite Night! Smite League - Europe

Hello all, 

I am starting a Smite league and have few teams interested. 

It will run weekly fixtures on Thursday nights at 8pm.

The aim is to create a sizeable league and then be able to split off into multiple leagues and have a hierarchy of skill level teams competing for the top league and the top spot! 

This post doesn’t apply to just teams though. It can also be multiple individual players and who knows you might meet people and form a team. 

We will also be looking for reserve players/subs. 

I accept anyone at any skill level, and I’m sure you will improve massively in this environment. 

Now, competitive environments can get heated. However this will be a well maintained league and even if you the best team or the best players I will not hesitate to remove threatening and abusive players. So to any nervous players out there, I will support you if you would like to be involved. I will not let the toxic masses run rampant.

If you are interested in joining this Smite league, please DM me.

Edit: if Sunday at 8pm suits you better there is talk of moving it to then."
Smite,What's with this new level 2 ganking solo,I've been noticing certain jungle gods like arachne and other gods with slow ganking solo immediately after clearing blue buff now this doesn't happen every game but it happens enough to start to wonder if this is a new  strategy or if it's something they copied from a pro player

At the very least, 2 people will have no banner, take over the pre match time  to buy items, only to build horribly, and in general just do stupid bullshit people at level 100 shouldn't be doing.

Smite,Why do y’all hate crit so much?,"Crit was actually in an okay spot. It was decent and there was always that counter: spectral armor. You built this item, you were feeling good. Problem is, you’re now buffing the counter, making it a lot better and crit a WHOLE lot worse. Okay fine whatever.
But then you need fail not. You know what that was needed. Only problem. You needed it into the freaking ground. Like barely anyone is going to pick that up now. And now crit is just... bad. Again. I wouldn’t really have a problem with it but then I think about how well you’re killing Mercury and you’re... kind of killing ne zha, just killing him a little bit. I liked crit. I thought it was a fun thing you could build it just wasn’t as your usual hunter builds. If I was playing against it, I didn’t really mind because well spectral exists but now it’s kind of like taking crit out of the game IMO"

Smite,Games/worshippers not tracking,"I have just played a game that hasn't tracked properly at all.


Although I was told I gained 8 worshippers, nothing was actually given to the God.


On my history the game doesnt even appear at all although I was awarded a first win of the day.  But i dont believe i received the favour.


Upon logging in I am sure I didn't receive my daily reward whatever it would have been.


Just me or has these been noticed?

Smite,So we just don’t get our tp?,"So ranked was broken for 5 days and we don’t get any of the tp we should have got from wins? Wtf is this hirez , all that time wasted and they didn’t safe mode anything? I think it’s finally time to move on from smite sadly.."
Smite,So with part of the new Chaac T5 that makes 3 to 0 on genderbents when you break it down by god.,"This was at the bottom but I decided to move it front and center - TL;DR for emphasis I'm **not** saying ""StOp MaKiNg GoDs InTo GoDdEssEs"" definitely KEEP doing it, but also give us something the other way while you're at it eh?

And if you break it down by actual skin it's 4(not gonna count the slight difference in the two Ruby Skins). Khepri, which is basically the bare minimum with just some model additions that are mostly nonintrusive and texture work. Valk Than which is the primo example of what can be done, ruby skins which are a bit less but still a lot of model difference and work, then the new T5 where it's part of a bigger selection of model changes. 

And no I'm not saying they shouldn't have been made, they are great additions. But so would be something like [this old and infamous Daji concept.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/b5tvlu/primal_hunter_da_ji_skin_concept_genderbend/) or one for bellona who doesn't have a lot of the often touted ""overly feminine"" animations which is what is brought up often as a reason to not do the aforementioned concept. Setting aside the fact ""floating"" is also a common argument like it was about Chibi's also(even though the first genderbend was for a nonfloating god), Baba yaga, Medusa, and Scylla all have alternative movement styles without traditional walking animations. And then just for good measure there's Kali who while having subtle hip motions would not need any really noticeable adjustment to fit a genderbent style. All of these gods being really varied and nice options. And it doesn't have to be full remodels, for some gods and goddesses something like the OG khepri one would be great."
Smite,How to teach a noob,"I have a friend that just started playing and I've gone over basics with him about how to maximize xp gain, jungles, basic attacks, roles, gods, items, relics, rotating, etc,... he's just not getting it. It's his first moba style game so I understand his struggle. This type of game just isn't clicking with him and he winds up getting frustrated. I play on a smurf account so he doesn't get ""completely"" annihilated btw.

Me and my other friend have been playing for over 6 years as well as another moba called ""Prime World"" before smite. So I have enough knowledge for him about the game, the only problem is it just doesn't stick. Maybe I'm dishing out to much info or something, idk.

So my question is, how would you teach a new player to progress quickly to at least be decent?"

Smite,Bruiser gods and Healing,"Bruisers like Chaac and Healers like...all healer that go damage are just not ok. Bruisers do too much damage now with things like Ancile and Sledge giving \~50 power each plus like 3+ other stats. After the antiheal nerf, people heal so much in combat. If you don't build cursed ankh +every antiheal item, they just outheal all damage.  


Edit: Just saw antiheal is getting reverted, Yay!  


Edit 2: While I'm ranting, Titans should have more team damage potential, such as AoE abilities, but with each Phoenix taken, an ability is taken."
Smite,Is anyone else having performance issues?,"First time playing smite in a week and I've had massive performance drops in almost every match.

Smite,Stone of Fal should proc on abilities too not just basic attacks.,"Stone of Fal is obviously in a really bad spot currently, and the rework is a step in the right direction, but making the passive centered around basic attacks seems like an odd choice. Personally, I would like to see that mitigation proc on abilities too, not just basic attacks.

At current the game is in a burst meta, and I as a support, even with all my protections, can't tank the brunt of a team for very long. As it stands now some roles like ADCs just shred tanks in seconds.  I don't think it is feasible for me in the mid-late game to walk up to the enemy to auto them 3 times for just 12% mitigation. By the time I benefit from the passive I'm probably out of position, and have now lost half my health.  It would be much more reliable if the passive proced on ability damage too so that I don't have to be horribly out of position in the mid-late game to benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to mention that with this hypothetical change the Stone of Fal passive would only proc once per ability. "

Smite,Cant emote before a match,"I can no longer use or preview an emote after selecting my character. I can buy a new emote, but it won’t preview it for me. If I buy one, I can’t use it while on character select screen. I can’t use or preview previously owned emotes either. We used to be able to until recently."
Smite,Speculating which Retro Skins are more likely to return,"So, with Retro Ao Kuang being revealed as well as /u/HiRezAjax revealing that it was kind of a secret project of his to bring those back, its quite clear that we're likely to see other Retro skins return, and thank goodness for that. However, because gods' visual updates did not happen in the same way, I'm going to separate them all into different tiers of how likely they are to return.

[Here is an image of the Tier List itself.](https://i.imgur.com/NY9kHso.png) Keep in mind, this is only speculated based on how much changed between the previous and current form. Now, on to the explanation:

The first tier is the easiest one to explain, the characters, despite model changes, retain mostly the same animations and thus, are easier to adapt into a skin. I included Hercules as an example, because you can see that Classic Hercules animates the same way as default Hercules. The same thing happened with Aphrodite, Arachne and old Sun Wukong when he was changed into Hun Batz. Now Anubis may be misplaced in this tier, but I'm pretty sure that his animations remained the same despite his new proportions.

Second tier would likely be slightly more complicated, but I assume it would also be easy to do. Ao Kuang/Kukulkan is an example of this, as their models have some noticeably different animations, but since their abilities are the same, this isn't a big concern. Bakasura and Ne Zha technically also demonstrate this, since their remodels didn't update older skins, they already use the old models with different animations, so bringing Retro skins shouldn't be a problem. Bastet may be a weird placement here, because she used the pre-rework kit and she is gonna get a rework anyway, but the current kit is still somewhat similar to the old one, so she fits better here than the next category...

...Which is gods that have some abilities that remained the same, with the same animations, but have some new completely different abilities. For those who don't know, Guan Yu's old Ultimate used to be the one that currently belongs to Amaterasu, so he had no horse to mount, and would require that if his Retro Skin was to be brought back. Loki's 3 and Ultimate and Odin's 3 would also require different animations, since they were not as... complex(?) when those gods had the old models.

Next comes a wierd category, because Nu Wa seemed to have been adapted well, but Kali most likely won't. Nu Wa's animations and abilities were completely different, but because she basically threw stuff with her staff, like the new version throws with her crystals, the animations were not much of a problem. Kali, on the other hand, had weird basic attack animations and no leap, so she would need new animations and would certainly be much harder to adapt than Nu Wa.

The last category is the one that is least likely to become skins, not because its hard to adapt, but simply because those champions are still similar in concept to back when they still had the old models. Hell, Zeus used the current card art before he even got a remodel, because the concept is the same, white hair and beard, toga, shield, the difference is in the proportions that are much better, same with the other characters in this tier. Also, yes, I intentionally left Hades out of the tier list, because he didn't receive a remodel as much as he got his default skin swapped with his Nightmare skin, so its not like he got anything new.

Keep in mind, this is only speculation, I don't know if this is actually how likely any of those skins will happen."

Smite,I'm offering to help any players that want to start learning Conquest!,"Hello, my name is GiraffeAnatomy and I'm offering to help any SMITE players that want to start learning Conquest.

This offer is more for the people who have been playing a while, but have only been playing Arena, Joust, Clash, etc. I recommend being above level 30 before you start. If you are a brand new player, I would not recommend jumping straight into Conquest, I would recommend playing Arena and Joust first to get your bearings on the game mechanics and to learn a handful of Gods.

I've been playing SMITE since Beta, and I just started making SMITE Guides to help bridge the gap between players that are newer, have been playing only Arena/Joust/Clash etc, and now want to jump into Conquest. I understand it can be daunting, so my aim is to give you a basic entry level explanation of Conquest and walk you through the game mode, explaining what everything is, what you would be doing as your preferred role, and how to eventually group up for teamfights, objectives, etc.

I will also be TOXIC FREE. That is the aim of this discord server, my teaching, and our community overall. I understand people are new and will make mistakes. I want this to be a safe learning environment for anyone just starting and are unsure of what to do. We have actually started to build a solid group of people since I posted on r/smitetraining and we have started to get people that are grouping up, playing together, and all learning Conquest together. Everyone's expectations are the same, so it is a great way to start learning conquest!

Please DM me and I'll invite you to my discord server where we can find a time to play together. I'm on PC and on the NA servers, but I have friends that play on EU, so I wouldn't mind playing with you if you're also on EU.

Have a great day, and I hope to see you all in game!

Also, just a disclaimer: The service is FREE. I just like playing SMITE, I'm not a professional player, and I don't make any money off streams or youtube or anything. I just want to get more people into SMITE, have them learn conquest, and bridge that gap from Arena/Joust/Clash to Conquest. I don't promise to get you so good you'll get into Platinum or Diamond rank, my goal is to just get newer players more comfortable with the Conquest game mode and SMITE in general. I know there can be a steep learning curve, and I'm here to help any way I can, and create a community of people that like playing together and learning from each other.

I also won't be doing ranked games, this is just going to be custom matches and casual games to get people acquainted to conquest."
Smite,Spectator Restrictions,"Hello! I was looking to making a Smite content video (Cinematic style) using the Spectator mode but obviously the Free Cam comes with X (Pan) and Y (Tilt) restrictions to the point where the options are slim.

Smite,Smite: The Forgotten Pantheon,"(A quick rundown if anyone hasn't watched the Update Show yet)

Chaac's new Tier 5 has actual lore behind it. The story is that this last remaining priest of a forgotten mythology finds a magical relic that allows him to channel the power of his deities into him in order to fight on the battleground of the gods and to bring this bygone pantheon back to its former glory. So far, we've only seen 3 of these gods; Optimism, Passion, and Rage. Sven describes them as manifestations of the human soul and embody emotions and feelings in the Update Show, and that got me thinking; what if they made a skinline that's based around this forgotten pantheon, with its gods finding vessels that they can channel their energy into to fight? I mean, there are plenty of ideas that can be expanded upon. If the gods of this pantheon embody human emotions, then Hi-Rez can practically go crazy since there are a lot of emotions and feelings out there they can deify and give form to."

Smite,"Aphrodite needs a fat nerf- not only because she’s busted in the healing meta, but because she’s anti-fun.","She’s just busted. You could play roulette with all the magic power and tank items and you’d probably end up helping your team more than whoever tf you lane against (solo,mid, or supp). She also becomes unkillable at level 5 because of her ridiculous healing and invincibility alongside beads/aegis. Oh, and let’s not forget about the protections she gets from her tacked on passive (mage btw lul) for absolutely no reason other than “fuck you.”

She’s also not fun to play against at all. I guarantee you every sane person who plays this game just groans when they see her on the enemy team. Hell, even the people PLAYING her don’t have fun. They legit just lock her in to win without trying. It’s literally just “ooga booga faceroll abilities” to win. 

Oh yea, and she gives out a 20% damage steroid late game, so your hunter or assassin can hit for 1200 damage a hit instead of 1000

Now that I’ve let that off my chest, here are some suggestions for a nerf so this post doesn’t get removed for being a rant.

Suggestion 1: revert anti heal nerfs and honestly revert all the bs healing changes in general.

This has been talked about quite a bit, but these healing changes clearly just put healers over the top. Not to mention anti heal got nerfed so it’s practically just a garbage item that you HAVE to buy against gods like Aphro. Meanwhile, the healer gets to buy an actually good item instead of divine ruin or pestilence or whatever. 

Suggestion 2: change healing to a separate stat

Also been suggested before, but I think it’s BS that Aphro and other healers can build any full damage, hybrid, or tank build, and still be useful.  Idk how it would be implemented, but if it nerfs healers and Aphro, I’m down for anything. 

Suggestion 3: banish Aphro to the shadow realm

Just nerf the crap outa her. Nerf bird damage, nerf jealousy steroid damage, nerf passive prots, nerf immunity time, nerf slow, nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf tf outa her. She’s the most anti-fun god in the game and nobody other than Aphro one tricks would actually care if she became useless (let’s be honest, the non-onetricks play her for reasons other than her kit lol).

Real talk though, her passive should get changed. Prots passives have no place on a healer mage. Give her something else that has synergy with her kit and actually makes sense. She has 20 years of immunity, self peel, and healing, so she doesn’t need to be even tankier. Her passive getting changed would make it so there is actually a chance of her dying in team fights.

Ok I’m done"

Her stats are amazing after game with damage being okay and minigations over the top. Yet KD always a hit or miss. She feels like a guardian yet she cant tank when needed and plays like a mage yet cant damage when needed. 
      All I can think is they wanted a mage who can Brawl and tank a little... yet they made a Gaurdian with the Hp and defense of a mage and is only useful late game if you survive that long in this new BS meta full of hackers ( I know I sound salty at this point saying smite is full of cheaters but trust me I have a mountain of stories.) ... sorry beside the point ... the point is  She feels like Baba yaga when she released just cool but disappointing infact same with Olorun ( what's with Smite bringing in mages that are powerful in lore and story yet so underwhelming in game.)

heroesofthestorm,༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Summon HotS Developer AMA ... This is sorta a test... MEME Week ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,"Howdy r/heroesofthestorm

We just implemented a new bot per a recent [request](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesmeta/comments/lx03f5/suggestion_having_a_bot_to_monitor_blizzards/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on r/heroesmeta that will create a summary of developer comments in a post as a top level stickied comment.  We were planning to implement this feature last year, but after the developer AMAs stopped, it fell off as a priority.  Shout out to the folks at the r/layer7 group for helping us setup the bot.

It has been about 235 days since our last developer AMA... but who's counting right :)  To be frank, I don't think the devs have time to respond to this request, I am sure they are very busy cooking up some great content for the year, but I wanted to test out this new bot so figured I would give it a try.

As an alternative to them responding to an AMA request I figure the devs really like the communities artwork and MEMEs, so as an alternative approach to entice the devs to comment we are having another MEME week.

MEME week is when you can post any type of artwork or MEME as long as it is HotS related in tone.  No politics or hate... just joy or sharing of common frustrations and suffering we have being fans of the game.

Flooding Rule is in effect too.  So pace your love for the game and humor.

Then check how long the slow lasts."
heroesofthestorm,Finally placed! Low key kinda proud,"After years of playing nothing but ARAMs and QM I finally nutted up and played some ranked today and placed into Gold 3!

heroesofthestorm,Falstad Quick Fix - Swap LVL 13 and 16 Talents,"TLDR; Swap Falstad's level 13 and 16 because it is consistent with other ranged assassins, it'll reduce his power a bit and make him feel more balanced, and it's an easy change for Blizzard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Historically, for ranged assassins, level 13 has been generally survivability/self-heal/movement speed/CC talents and level 16 has been the big power spike with damage-oriented talents involving % health, armor reduction, CDR/increase to number of charges, or even just a flat damage buff. For instance: 

[Zul'jin](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/zuljin-talents#level-13)

* **Level 13 (survivability/move speed/CC)**
   * Lacerate - Increase Twin Cleave Slow
   * Eye of Zul'jin - Basic Attacks grant Move Speed
   * Ensnare - Throw a net that Roots enemies
* VS
* **Level 16 (armor ignore, damage, attack speed)**
   * No Mercy! - Basic Attacks ignore Armor, deal more damage
   * Wrong Place Wrong Time - Bonus Twin Cleave damage at apex
   * Let the Killing Begin - Killing enemies increases Attack Speed

See also [Fenix](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/fenix-talents#level-13), [Greymane](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/greymane-talents#level-13), [Gul'dan](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/guldan-talents#level-13), [Lunara](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/lunara-talents#level-13), [Hanzo](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/hanzo-talents#level-13), [Tychus](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/tychus-talents#level-13), [Raynor](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/raynor-talents#level-13), [Orphea](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/orphea-talents#level-13), [Zagara](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/zagara-talents#level-13), [Cassia](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/cassia-talents#level-13), and [Chromie](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/chromie-talents#level-13), among others. 

Of course. this isn't always the case, (like [Sylvanas](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/sylvanas-talents#level-13) who has her damage-y, armor-reduction talents at 13 and survivability at 16), and there are also other heroes who mix things up between these talent tiers, so it's not consistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

But with the reworked Falstad, he is set up like Sylvanas where he receives his power spike at level 13 instead of 16:

* **Level 13 (damage increase, CDR, % dmg)**
   * Thunderstrikes - Lightning Rod deals increasing damage
   * Flow Rider - Tailwind recharges Basic Abilities faster
   * Sustained Winds - Increase Basic Attacks against Heroes
* VS
* **Level 16 (CC, survivability/move speed)**
   * Crippling Hammer - Increases Hammerang Slow, explosion Slows
   * Aerie Gusts  - Reduce Tailwind delay, increase Move Speed
   * Afterburner  - Barrel Roll increases Move Speed

&amp;#x200B;

Reworked Falstad feels pretty strong at the moment, and I think his level 13 Thunderstrikes for W build is one reason. I think a very simple way Blizzard can reduce his power slightly, but not make drastic changes, and make him feel more balanced to play against is... **if his level 13 and 16 talents were** **swapped**. 

This will push his big damage boost to slightly later in the game and consistent with other heroes, making him somewhat more manageable until then. And it'll be more risky for Falstad players at level 16 to stick to targets with W build, when other ranged assassins have their powerful level 16 talents and death timers are longer. 

Playing against Falstad will become similar to playing against heroes who do have big late-game power spikes, like Zeratul. And you might have more options for counterplay with some of the level 16 talents that come online, like Ana's Active Reload, Anduin's and Lucio's talents that buff their heals, Anubarak's Debilitation, Blaze's Juggernaut Plating, and Sonya's Nerves of Steel."
heroesofthestorm,Deathwing needs a new level 20 talent,"**Problem 1:** Deathwing's level 20 talents aren't exciting to pick, because you can barely use them since they're all attached to other long cooldowns.  They're tied to either R (90 cd) or Z (45 cd + over 10 more).  People mostly pick the R upgrade, because it can at least be used when already fighting. But none are great. 

Every other hero can pick a lev 20 talent that's usable more frequently, either attached to basic attacks, basic abilities, permanently passive, or which adds its own cooldown.   


**Problem 2:** At high levels Deathwing feels really flimsy. He often ends up as a backline artillery mage, who hides behind tougher allies once the shooting starts. 

The reason for his squishiness is other heroes' talent upgrades. As level advances from 2 to 20, the red assassins add all kinds of damage boosts, especially ones that bypass armor. At the same time, the blue healer is adding talents to protect the rest of his team *except Deathwing*.  Not only does Deathwing become relatively weaker to enemy damage, he also gets squishy compared to anyone who can be healed or buffed. 

Deathwing's own talents cannot keep up.  He can only get one defense talent, at 16, and it only works for a few seconds on a long cooldown.  It doesn't help counter the sustained dps of red ranged assassins. 

**Truth:** Alexstrasza 20 can sometimes win 1v5. Deathwing 20 usually loses 1v1.

**Solution:** Give Deathwing a new level 20 talent talent which makes it harder for the enemy to kill him.  I won't spell out exactly what it should be, because the details are less important than adding *something*.  But here are some possible directions:

* **Armor**.  Maybe losing a plate is only -6 armor, or maybe he gets +1 plate (for 50 total).  Probably a poor idea, because it would only intensify the motivation to counterpick him with percent damage.
* **Lifesteal.** Ability damage to heroes gives Deathwing a portion of the damage as shields, and takedowns grant a large chunk.
* **Fly Away**.   Animations for Z and R go faster and aren't interrupted by enemy action.  (Pretty boring)
* **Toughness**.  Deathwing has 40% less max health, but takes 40% less damage from literally all sources.  That's ALL sources, including Tychus and Greymane.  (Notice that in addition to resisting percent attacks, this effect also boosts the healing value of level 1 talents)."

We had 3 afk players within the first like 10mins of a ranked game on Towers of Doom. We weren’t that far behind but people just dip. It’s literally one of the bests maps for comebacks IMO but it seems like people really just can’t stand the Defeat screen.

heroesofthestorm,The Lost Vikings - Time for Change,"**Hey Guys,**

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk about Vikings(again). They are sitting on top of winrate but we shouldnet forget that 8,82 are pickrate so that means ""only good TLV Player "" playing them.

The thing abou **vikings is to change some ""core"" settings** to make them feel different as they are now.

*Maybe some of you guys can give some good inputs as well.*

Lets beginning with the Auto Attack Damage and Range .

Olaf - 57 / 1,20

Baleog - 78 / 4

Erik - 65 / 6,5

Its clear that they are high compare to other heros because thats their only dmg(without spin to win).

I would shift that a little bit more.  **Take some dmg from Olaf and Erik and give it to the true Fighter of them Baleog**. In origin he is the Fighter who destroy Monster and enemys.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we going to talk about Talents.

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 1  &gt;**

Olaf the Stout &gt; Olaf Transform into a good Tank (pickrate OVR 30,06)

Spy Games &gt; Erik can spy and doing nice dmg with it (Pickrate OVR 17,79)

Explosive Attacks &gt; Baleog clear lanes faster (Pickrate OVR 15,47)

Viking Bribery &gt; Camps value (Pickrate OVR 36,69)

&amp;#x200B;

Comment: **I think this Tier is really ok.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 4 &gt;**

Pain dont Hurt &gt; This Talent is good but have on big problem ..Erik the Swift (Pickrate OVR 17.79)

Erik the Swift &gt; This talent is the strongest without doubt. (Pickrate OVR 47,07)

Its a Sabotage &gt; The worst Talent from this hero and of the worst of all Heroes (Pickrate OVR 4,86)

Mercenary Lorg &gt; Good for the Pushing build (Pickrate OVR 30,28)

&amp;#x200B;

**Comment**: *Erik gets so much with this talent and it is without doubt the best Talent.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 7&gt;**

Baleog tbe Fierce &gt; Cool idea BUT one viking can die fast and so your Teamfight build is destroyed (Pickrate OVR 17,79)

Spin to Win &gt; By far the Number one Pick here. You need not all Vikings to be alive to activate it (Pickrate OVR 63,20)

Norse Force &gt; I like this Talent a lot. The Problem in this Tier is clarly spin to win (Pickrate OVR 13,59)

&amp;#x200B;

**Comment**: ***NERF Spin to Win.***   *Make Bonus dmg 80% to Heroes instead of 100%.* 

Give Baleog the Fierce maybe some Movement Speed to dodge some kind of abilitys.  

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 10**

Longbot Raid &gt; Wonderful ulty BUT you cannot take it most of the times.. (Pickrate OVR 8,52)

Play Again &gt; You can see the pickrate so no more words needed... (Pickrate OVR 91,48)

&amp;#x200B;

Comment: You see whats going on..  Longboat raid NEED some buffs. Lets start with Movement Speed and Mortar need to be faster as well (like Mephistos Q) .

If Things doesent change it need more buffs and you can nerf Play again CD to 110 or 120 seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 13**

Hunka Burning Olaf &gt; First of all.. Change his Name to ""Olaf Secret Gas attack"" and it should make dmg like poison    ...   (Pickrate OVR 7.85)

Jump &gt; no words needed (Pickrate OVR 55.72)

Nordic Attack Squad - You can see that this talent have some good time since his buffs (Pickrate OVR 36,43)

&amp;#x200B;

**Comment**: *The Buffs to Nordic Attack Squad has changed that tier a little bit.*   

&amp;#x200B;

LVL 16

Large and in charge &gt; By far the best pick (Pickrate OVR 76,67)

Impatience is a Virtue &gt; Good idea but ... (Pickrate OVR 9,50)

64 KB Marathon &gt; For me its a funny talent but for lvl 16 it is bad (Pickrate OVR 3,40)

Executioner &gt; Not a bad talent but to get value it is too hard (Pickrate OVR 10,43)

&amp;#x200B;

**Comment**:  *This Tier need some fresh changes.*

*Here i would go into some crazy idea...*

 *Give ""Impatience is a Virtue to lvl 13 that this Talent have some more value..  And in the opposite give Jump to Talent 16.* 

*64 KB Marathon should going into another Tier aswell.*

&amp;#x200B;

**LVL 20** \&gt;

Ragnarok n Roll &gt; no words needed (Pickrate OVR 2.81)

Chepoint Reached &gt; No words needed (Pickrate OVR 12.,38)

The Sequel &gt; Good Talent but for lvl 20 not good enough (Pickrate OVR 11,88)

Fury of the Storm &gt; By far the best Talent (Pickrate OVR 72,94)

&amp;#x200B;

Comment: It needs some drastically change as well.

&amp;#x200B;

While i was writing this long text-... I have something so say again on Longboat Raid.

**Maybe and this is only a idea -&gt; Take Talent  The Sequel and combine it with Longboat Raid.**

So Vikings can die but have the chance to come back again ""faster"".   50 % Faster to be alive is maybe too good but iam not a Person for numbers :D .

&amp;#x200B;

I hope ""WE Vikings/Hots Players"" can give some good ideas to the Hots Team so they can change something.

&amp;#x200B;

My target is that Vikings can fight more but not too effective  -&gt; thats why nerf spin to win.

Baleog lvl 7 with Movement Speed should come with attacks so he isnt that easy to kill. 

&amp;#x200B;

So lets the talk begin

&amp;#x200B;

heroesofthestorm,Random unreadying in draft,Since yester day i have facing this when queuing with friends the leader continuously gets unreadied and there is a error message. I don't know what's causing this hoping someone is able to help
heroesofthestorm,One of my friends refuses to play objectives... how to handle?,"So, a group of my friends and I have been playing HotS together, sometimes we even have a full 5 stack. A couple of my friends are less experienced with the game, so I have been filling the role of healer because they only have a small handful of characters they are happy playing.

One of my friends in particular likes to play Ragnaros and Sylvanas, and really enjoys split pushing. Routinely, we are team fighting 4v5 on objectives while he pushes a side lane, and I usually request that he join at objectives to help secure them. To clarify, I only ask this when he have comparable EXP to the enemy team, I am not asking him to fight while we are a talent level behind or something. He has vocally complained about this, saying it is stupid and strategically wrong. I am unsure if it is whether he is tilted at being told what to do or just bad a positioning, but when he does join fights he usually runs straight into the enemy team and dies and says something like ""See? I told you it was stupid to teamfight"".  


This culminated in him telling myself and the other most experienced HotS player in the group (we are both greater than 4 times his player level) that he thinks we play the game wrong and then he left our discord. This is a close friend who I still want to play with, but I genuinely don't know how to handle the situation both from a strategic standpoint in game as well as from a social perspective.

Just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues and how they handled the situation."
heroesofthestorm,Heroes of the Dorm,"As March Madness rolls around again, I find myself missing Heroes of the Dorm. I know there will never be another $10000 bracket challenge to win or massive scholarships for the winners, but it would be amazing to have an organization join with Tespa again to coordinate a college tournament.  I would still be happy to have a $100 bracket challenge and be able to root for a local college team to win it all."
heroesofthestorm,Has Anyone Ever Had A Ban Appealed?,"Just as the title says. I’m wondering if anyone has ever actually had a ban appealed. It seems like the entire process is automated, even the customer service seems like an automation. This is especially concerning considering there isn’t a contact number you can call to talk to a real person. 

It’s especially humorous, if you submit a ban appeal ticket, they automatically mark the ticket as resolved, and the link they provide to re-open the ticket, isn’t actually valid. 

Their response is:
“You said a swear word. 
That violates ToS.
This decision is final.” 

I could write a computer program in about 5min that does what these ‘people’ supposedly do. The entire processes is ridiculous and it’s stuff like this that makes me think, no wonder the games dying. I love this game, but stuff like this, just an absolute sheer lack of service, makes me want to quit."
heroesofthestorm,Any tips for a new player?,"So I just started playing and was wondering if you guys had any tips for a new player? I don’t really have any experience in this type of top down camera angle style of game.

Also do you guys know if any of my fortnite or valorant skills will transfer over?

heroesofthestorm,Falstad needs a nerf. Urgently.,"I'm happy with the change on Hammerang. But his W is just too good for being so simple. Early game you can farm stacks on a tank so by midgame you can start melting enemy assassins AND reset cooldown with each subsequent kill. By lategame, a smart use of Lightning Rod's resets will yield you a victory in every team fight.

Plus, he has his usual ""Falstad things"": escape/engage tools, an ultimate that can steal bosses and an almost global presence.

At the moment, he is a beast. Playing him reminds me of Kael'thas and Li-Ming on release."
heroesofthestorm,Any Lucio fans out there.,"I recently got into Lucio I never gave him time of day when healing. But he actually has a kit that can sustain heal quite well as long as the enemies aren't focus targeting too bad. Plus boombox is probably one of the most underrated things in the game right now. Imagine having an observer Ward every 20 seconds for free in DotA.

Has anyone else had fun healing with Lucio. What's the general consensus on them is he low tier or high tier."
heroesofthestorm,Let's talk about streamers and Grubby,"I don't get why people say that he's a chill and nice guy, every single game he always whines and complains about his team mates like crazy, being passive aggressive against them and blames everyone but himself. He thinks that everyone should read his mind and play the exact type of way he think is acceptable and the moment they don't do that he becomes toxic. He does this in every game in which he doesn't stomp and seeing him act like this against his team mates while having his chat stroke his ego calling them stupid and useless really kills the mood.

&amp;#x200B;

And the problem is not just Grubby, nearly every single HotS streamer is like this I feel. If you start watching a HotS stream it takes max 5min before they start to complain and blame team mates like crazy while having their chat stroke their ego. It's no wonder this community is more toxic than any other moba game when even the most wholesome and chill streamer is toxic as heck."

In the case of Illidan, I personally don't think the change impacted him that much. Illidan's general strategy continues to be avoid fights until level 10 where he has a global or an extra means of survability.   


But in Probious' case, moving all his pylon talents to level 4 could make him a more impactful hero and give him a pseudo support status. Just something I've always wanted to see and hope that it's implemented in some way."

heroesofthestorm,Grom Hellscream: The Character,"Hey guys, I'm bored and have a few hours to kill so I'm gonna go dumb and build my favorite Blizzard character; Grom Hellscream. Be warned. I'm trying to be stupid. Stupid awesome. 

Trait: Deal with the Daemons. When Hellscream dies, he unleashes a powerful scream, reducing the armor and movement speed of everyone around him, for three seconds. His skin turns red, and he grows twice as large. During this time Hellscream can cast his Gorehowl's Blade for free, and it does 50% damage. If Gorehowl's Blade connects with three separate targets, or kills a target, Hellscream is rooted and invulnerable for two seconds, and then comes back to life. 

Fuck yes it's broken. Grom Hellscream is supposed to be terrifying. All the melee assassins in this game are hit and run characters. They go in do their damage, and then get out. Not Hellscream. You run from Hellscream. 

Q: Gorehowl's Blade. Hellscream is rooted for two seconds while charging up a straight line area attack directly in front of him. During this time he will charge up a scream. After the two seconds he unleashes an attack (with a scream, obvs) that kills the target. Not actually kills them, but like... damage. So much damage. He cannot cast other abilities, or move, until after the attack. Oh and this ability has no cooldown. Just do it as often as you like. 

The entire design of Hellscream is that he has no survivability and limited gap closing, and, in fact, benefits from putting himself in high risk, deadly situations, where he will likely die. Because of the high charge up time, and short range, the reward needs to be extremely deadly. And yeah it's busted that he can just do this as often as he likes. I love it.  

W: Sidestep. Hellscream hops a short distance on a one second cooldown. Hop bro hop. This is literally his one survival tool, but potentially hilarious and powerful. Just always able to get sliiiiiightly out of range of those AoE effects. Again, rewarding a high risk, high damage play. 

E: Hellscream. Hellscream unleashes a scream that fears all nearby minions, and lowers the armor of all Heroes by 30% for 3 seconds. 10s cooldown. 

You might notice I have Hellscream screaming a lot. It's in the name boo. I wanted Hellscream to have plays around minion waves, while generally upping the damage he can unleash if everything comes together. 

R1: Mannorath's Blood. Unleashing a, you guessed it, powerful scream, Hellscream is thrown into a Daemonic Rage. Growing in size, and becoming red, Gorehowl's Blade's charge up is reduced to 0.5 seconds, and his damage is increased by 50%. The effect lasts for 6 seconds. When it ends, Hellscream dies. The buff persists through Deal with the Daemon's. 

Frick yeah. Hellscream just owns everyone and, if he's lucky, his trait will trigger and he'll survive. Does it sound absolutely stupid? Yes. Is it awesome? Yes. 

R2: Journey to Draenor. Calling on daemonic energy, Hellscream teleports a single Hero into an alternate world where they fight 1v1 for 7 seconds. 

Fuck yeah I like Mordekaiser. YOU CAN'T JUDGE ME FOR IT! Lawl. 

Level One Talents

Graceful Step: Sidestep doubles in distance. 

Timed Attack: Hellscream can cast Sidestep as Gorehowl's Blade is charging. 

Sidestep King: If Sidestep avoided damage equal to, or greater than, 5% of Hellscream's total health, Hellscream gains invulnerability for 1 second. 

I really wanted the tier one talents to be all about the Hop, and to make it a defining choice for how people want to approach him. Graceful Step is the ""dunder"" talent in the tier; it's obviously good for obvious reasons. Timed Attack opens up great aggression options for Hellscream, while Sidestep King will give skilled players a touch of survivability, which Hellscream lacks. 

Level 4 Talents

Die By My Blade: Hellscream can move while charging Gorehowl's Blade. 

Stay Put: Gorehowl's Blade stuns for 1.5 seconds. 

Striding Daemon: If Gorehowl's Blade does no damage, Hellscream gains 30% movement speed for three seconds. The charge up of Gorehowl's Blade, during this time, is halved. 

Die By My Blade is such a clear upgrade, that I wanted the other talents in the tier to have a nice powerful feeling as well. Stay Put has a lot of ""stun lock"" potential, as the stun lasts 1.5 seconds, while it takes 2 seconds to charge up an attack, giving Hellscream potential to land two powerful blows. Striding Demon is a nice option for people who are struggling to land the attack, or who are looking to make a quick exit. 

Level 7

Cower Before Me: If Hellscream hits only one hero, that Hero is feared and rooted for 1 second. 

Band of Brothers: Allies in Hellscream's radius do 20% more damage. 

Mocking Assault: Dealing damage, to heroes, with Gorehowl's Blade resets Hellscream's cooldown. 

Level 13 - 

Ambush: If Gorehowl's Blade deals damage while in, or moving out of a bush (1.5 seconds), it does double damage. 

Silent Warrior: If Grom remains stationary for 2 seconds, he gains invisibility. He keeps his invisibility for 1 second after moving. 

Numbers Are Meaningless: If Gorehowl's Blade deals damage to a minion, and a Hero, all minions in a sizable radius die, and the Hero is slowed by 20% for 2 seconds. 

Level 16

Gateway: Grom can travel to anywhere on the map via a Daemon Gate. 200 second cooldown. 

Blast the Gates: Grom plants a Goblin Bomb that does massive structural damage. 200 second cooldown

What's With All The Goofy Stuff?: Grom Gains 30% movement speed and 30% armor. 200 second cooldown 

Level 20

Daemon's Pledge: If Deal with the Daemon's saves Grom after Mannorath's Blood kills him, his resurrection is instant and Mannorath's Blood recasts instantly. There is no cooldown on this effect. 

Draenor's Wrath: Grom gains 50% armor and 50% damage during Journey to Draenor. 

End It: When Gorehowl's Blade kills a target, it's damage is permanently increased by 10%. 

This was fun as heck! Let me know what you guys think! I love Hellscream, and I'd love to hear his signature scream in the Nexus."
heroesofthestorm,Blizzard needs to add an 'accept' button for the queues,"I play on OCE servers, and during offpeak it's common for about a third of my games to have an AFK on either team. It's mostly because the queue times can be so long and the estimated wait for heroes nowhere near reflects the actual time it takes to queue. Everyone pretty much has to be doing something else during the queue, and they just minimize their game and forget they are even in it. Simply adding a feature where people have to press a button to accept they are ready would stop beginning games with an AFK for 2 minutes until it turns into a bot or they come back."
heroesofthestorm,Anyone know why custom lobbies are broken?,"Been happening all night randomly, just unable to start or lobby immediately disbanding to menu screen upon start. Does seem to work eventually after enough restarts."
heroesofthestorm,What is smurfing in your understanding?,"Hi guys, just had a funny braxis silver game, where my teammate lastpicked aba and was doing stuff like afk hat, slapping boss, Z into lane and dying etc. After the game i asked him why he did that. His reply was

""i wanted you to earn your win. smurfs ruin this game""

The thing is it is my only account. I have lvl 333 with 1200 QM games on EU and now i'm playing on US (lvl100 with 39 SL games). For some reason i was placed close to bronze and have to make my way up.

&amp;#x200B;

Does that count as smurfing in your eyes? if yes, what should someone do if they move between regions? Should bliz have single account across regions?"
heroesofthestorm,Damage Scaling,"So I've been playing Heroes of the Storm for a while, but I don't think I figured this out. Do talents that provide a flat damage increase to an ability (like Alarak's lvl 4 talent that buffs Discord Strike) scale up as you level up? Or does that damage stay the same? Guess I never really paid much attention to the numbers."
heroesofthestorm,"As much as I love HoTS, game is unplayable.","I'd like to start it by saying I'm a returning player but unfortunately I don't think I can say that because I just don't know if I'll be returning for sure. Having played the game since it's alpha, reached Hero League rank 1 (or something like that, I don't remember the exact name/title) and Masters a few times, I don't think I've ever seen so much toxicity in a single place.

&amp;#x200B;

I started by playing some quickmatches to get the hang of the game again since so many new heroes have been lunched since I've stopped, but I just can't. Every single game there's at least one afker from the start. Last game I just had thre people sit at fountain THREE MINUTES into the game. I don't know, maybe the two deaths on our side were too much for them to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved this game once and I'd really want to love it again. It is by far my favourite moba but, as it is, it is unplayable. Are reports having any effect on people? Is Blizzard doing anything to adress this?"
heroesofthestorm,How to Climb out of Bronze Hell?,"Yes, another topic with this title. 

I feel like I am cursed. I have fallen from Gold 3 to Bronze 2 this season. Whether I queue alone or not, this season I literally can't seem to catch a break. I started 11-2, then out of nowhere I  lost **19 straight**. You read that right. 

Since then, about 80% of my games in Gold, Silver, and now Bronze have *at least* one of the following:

* Someone goes AFK at the start of the game and we are left with AI
* Someone gives up about 5 minutes into the game, then proceeds to complain and blame everyone else on the team
* Someone picks a character they admit they have no idea how to play (not my biggest pet peeve, but still annoying)
* Someone starts intentionally feeding from the start of the game
* Someone picks Azmo, TLV, or another laning character and seems to be a bot, as they don't respond to anything all game, play like a human would, or help in teamfights

&amp;#x200B;

These were my games today:

* **Game 1: Troll/AFK -** Person banning bans all of the picks we are showing. Then they go AFK at the start of the game, so we are left with AI. One guy that had his pick banned picks a random tank he doesn't know how to play to ""get back"" at the person who banned, then lanes all game and gets camps, dives in 1v5 and dies, and ignores the objective and teamfights. We lost in about 10 minutes.
* **Game 2: AFK -** Someone AFK during draft, so game drops
* **Game 2: AFK -** Someone AFK during draft AGAIN, so game drops
* **Game 2: Troll/AFK** \- Abathur moves to inner keep and just sits there. Doesn't get close to soak XP, doesn't hat anyone, and just goes AFK randomly throughout the game. Never uses ult once. At the end of the game when the rest of us complain and call to report them, he starts saying how bad all of us are at our characters even though they clearly lose the game for us. We lose in about 13 minutes. I finish with all but one of the kills and more than half of the damage of my entire team. 
* **Game 3: Troll/AFK -** During draft, no one except me is showing. Someone first picks Butcher (wasn't showing at all before they picked), then someone has to pick a second character but still no one is showing. I switch my pick from damage to Tank so we at least have that. Someone says they will fill, shows a healer, then switches their pick at the last second to damage. Our Butcher feeds, we have no healer, one person goes AFK at the start of the game and gives up because the other guy did not pick a healer, and we lose badly in about 10 minutes.

Most wins I only receive about 160-180 points, and most losses I lose 200-220+ points. I've been keeping track and it is ridiculous. My KDA has fallen from 5+ to 3.7, and my win rate has gone from an average of about 53% to about 48%.

I'm not a top-tier player for sure, and I know everyone says this but I honestly don't feel like I should be in Bronze. I have been playing for 4 years and climbed to Gold from Bronze 5. I soak, I get camps when it is safe before objectives, and I try not to die a lot, but this season has been the worst gaming experience of my life. I accept the fact that I could have gotten worse, but this is ridiculous.

Does anyone have any advice for climbing out of Bronze right now? I honestly feel like something has changed in the last few months and that I am getting queued differently or something. :("
heroesofthestorm,How do you switch left and right click?,"I've been trying to switch my left and right click buttons in this game, but can't seem to find an answer that works.

When assigning commands to buttons, you can assign anything to right click, but left click cannot be assigned to anything. The game never registers the left click input as a viable option

I also tried inverting the left and right click for my PC before entering the game. Left click is swapped, but this appears to completely disable the left click so I can't move at all in a match.

Are there any other options? The above two answers are what I keep seeing."
heroesofthestorm,My solution to falstad W,"I am more of a lurker than a poster on this sub, but many people complain about the falstad semi rework and i would like to state my opinion and see what you guys think about it. 

I think that while the W dmg is indeed high, the most obnoxious part about this skill is that its super hard to escape. The damage is not applied immediatly, but its hard to escape and interrupt. If the range was lower and thus put falstad in more danger, it would be easier to punish him."

heroesofthestorm,"Jesus, catapult minions are too strong","So, we are on braxis, it's more or less even, we're nearly thirty minutes in.  They destroyed all our forts/keep, we destroyed all but one of theirs (and the red keep still left is nearly destroyed), we fight for the objective and hey, it's a difference of just one catapult every two waves, it shouldn't matter *that* much, right?    

#WRONG      

While we killed all their team/fought for the two points, our minion wave (which had been almost at their still intact keep) got pushed back by a rocket launcher minion.    
Then it got pushed back further         
and further   
and further   
and further, their rocket launcher killing our minions before they could really make a dent into theirs and continuing to  move forward, joined by more and more red minions (including one, then a second, catapult).     

so, just as our zerg wave was unleashed (100 to 0), just as we moved to join them to finally end this game...       
our core got taken down  in less than a minute  
by just three fucking catapults       


fuck this game"

heroesofthestorm,Updated for current balance patch: The statistically most OP individual Talents for Storm League (web scraping/analysis project),"Hi, many people seemed to find the last post useful, so I wanted to officially publish updated results for the current balance patch (with a couple improvements, such as displaying the Hero name in the table).

Update of this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/lvgcp1/the_statistically_most_op_talentsbuilds_by_map_in/

tl;dr of methdology, the Talents that have the highest proven Winrate increase purely by selecting them at a given part of the game. Standardized to reward Talents with a high sample size and which are higher than baseline at that part of the game (so that the list isn't dominated by only level 20 Talents which have a high average Winrate, since not every game goes to 20). Shown in descending order of confidence of being better than baseline at that state of the game. NOT adjusted for Hero strength, since the whole point was to find the strongest builds in the game overall, not just whatever boosts Medivh's winrate up from 41% to 49% or whatever.

This includes results ONLY post-hotfix (Falstad/Tyrael bugs mostly fixed)

**Result tl;dr** Falstad W build is the most OP build, second is still Sonya's W build (untouched this patch), then ZJ Recklessness, Mei W build, Anub Beetle build, Uther W quest with D Storm, Vikings Play Again, Jaina AA build (!!), Run it Down Azmo, Q build Kerrigan with Ultra, Stukov with Ballistospores, DVa, Lucio new High Five

heroesofthestorm,Is there an up to date Solo Lane Match-up Guide for a returning player?,"Hi All,

I'm a returning playing from a couple of years ago. Happy to say that I'm thoroughly enjoying the game again!

But... I always enjoyed the solo lane and with all the hero patches that have happened since I left the hero match ups have definitely changed. I find I no longer know the match-ups. All the information I could find are from when I last left.

Is anyone still putting these solo lane guides out there? Or did they get lost with HGC?"
heroesofthestorm,Ana's talents at lvl 16 and 20,"Would love to see them ""shuffled"" a bit. Having two levels (13 and 16) where all 3 talents focus on a single ability is quite boring in my opinion, it also makes my gameplay feel forced into a single way of playing.
(Not to mention how tilting it can be to try to land your Qs with a team that tries to avoid every skillshot coming towards them ;p )

Why not take one of the lvl 20 trait-talents, nerf it slightly and make it an option at lvl 16 ? ""Increase the damage of your doses by 40%"" doesn't sound too strong (or?)"
heroesofthestorm,"What ""%"" of games end AFTER both teams reach lv 20? + About the duration of maps.","Is such stat shown somewhere?

  
Thing is, some heroes become quite strong at 20 (Valla?), whereas others barely get a tiny bit of power at that level.

Also, are all maps designed to have the same duration in the games in them? Or some maps have shorter games than others?  


Thanks."
heroesofthestorm,Masterleague alternative,"I remember [masterleague.net](https://masterleague.net) being an awesome source of HoTS tournament data, especially tournament builds. Unfortunatelly it's no longer updated since around when HGC got canceled. Is there now a similar website that covers current HoTS tournaments like CCL, Master Clash etc?"

heroesofthestorm,Why is every character free to play?,"Haven't played in a long time, why is every character playable? For most games I played in my life this was usually a sign that the game would shut down soon"
heroesofthestorm,"There's nothing wrong with playing poorly, but there's everything wrong with harassing someone for it","This goes to everyone except the top 1%,

&amp;#x200B;

Great! you're a great player! Now stop harassing players for playing poorly because they have all the right to play the game, be bad at it and improve. OK?

Just because you saw them make a ""mistake"", doesn't mean they are losing the game for you. Your perception of the match ongoing is not a complete one! 

If you are wondering why you are getting silenced or what's up with the recent ban on your account, let me put it this way for you to understand: Imagine you're a basketball player and you've been playing and training for 5 years. Now imagine one day you play in a public park with strangers instead of your usual teammates. Would you go up to the 11-year old in your team and tell them how much they suck and that they are the worst point guard you've ever seen? You know what would ensue that if you do say those things? You would get banned from the park. Who'd a thunk!

Finally, if you are wondering if someone was trolling, it isn't. There's nothing subtle about trolling, even the enemy team will be able to tell. And if so, you can still win with a troll on your team. I've seen it happen many times.

Edit: to the people saying ""playing bad is being toxic"", I'm sorry, it isn't. If you don't want to play with bad players, good luck finding a game where that is the case. It isn't your personal playground, people are allowed to be ""bad"" and that's the foundation of any gaming community. You can help them improve but you can't harass someone for it. That is not cool no matter how you wanna justify it."

Good week-end to y'all"
heroesofthestorm,Mephisto skull talent changes,"Hi there. In the latest patch, Mephisto's q talents have been buffed, and although I'm a big fan of him and his skull skill, I'm a little bit sad about the changes. The reason is the removal of his old lvl1 quest reward, the 3s lower skull cooldown.

That lvl1 q talent quest reward was the main reason I always enjoyed playing this hero so much. This probably sounds riddiculus and I'm not exaggerating, I promise. The synergy of the shorter q cooldown with his passive made hitting your skills so satisfying. You were reducing much larger portions of your skull's cooldown, which made you more opportunities to proc your passive again and this whole positive feedback loop was so awesome and allowed you to really feel the very rewarding effect of one of the most interesting passives in the game. Whenever I finished the lvl1 quest, I had a blast.

Now I've played several games with the new skull talents and it definitely doesn't feel bad, the second charge is really nice and the dmg buff is very noticeable, but that unique feeling from the 5s skulls is not there. I'd give up the 40% execute dmg, 25% spell power or the second charge for the 3s cdr without hesitating, even if it made the build weaker.

Now I want to make it clear that this is just my personal opinion. I don't think his skull talents are weaker, I certainly do not think that this was a bad change and I also don't think that if I enjoy the new talents less, other people will too. This is all just me talking about my weird addiction to his old lvl1 talent. I'd like to know what other people think about the changes. I hope that people enjoy his new buffed q build (while I also secretly hope that we'll see his 5s skulls return some day in the future)."
heroesofthestorm,Why I cannot leave when a teammate leaves?,"I don't understand why no other MOBA with the exception of DOTA 2 does this, I'm not having fun it's just waiting to lose 99% of the time.

heroesofthestorm,Why is Purifier Beam weaker than Planet cracker,"Ok, Purifier Beam is a global (but so is planet cracker), and it tracks the target, but its fired from the Spear of Adun. It shouldn't even be in the same league as something fired from a Dragoon. Did the beam gets weaker as it tracks across the galaxy?"
heroesofthestorm,Just came back to hots after 3 year break. Now how do I get the new heroes?,"I don't like one-tricking or even missing any heroes So I decided to try and grind for gold or something. What options do I have though? Pretty much just daily quests right? That's gonna take forever. I am missing more than 10 heroes and I have gold for half a hero. I don't want to play any real match before I unlock the heroes and learn to play every hero again. Thinking about just playing AI games for the daily quests. I hate playing real games when I don't know how the heroes work. Really enjoy drafting, countering and synergy between heroes.

I's it possible to keep up with this game (hero changes especially) when only playing a few matches a day and not every day?"
heroesofthestorm,Getting Banned,"I've read a few threads about people getting banned by doing nothing or it being a one off insult type thing but scrolling through this sub I came across one that peaked my interest. The person was asking if simply calling someone out was bannable but (to their credit) posted the chat log in the comments which proved that wasn't the case at all. Reminded me of my years in loss prevention whenever you caught someone stealing and they'd say ""this was their first time! I'll never do it again!"" knowing this isn't their first time, its only the first time they've been caught!

So I'm curious if anyone has some honest stories about how/why they got banned OR if they believe they've been banned for an unjustified reason?"
heroesofthestorm,New player (but not new to MOBAs) - is co-op vs. AI useful at all to learn?,"I'm coming in this game way late, I know (while it's potentially dying?), but have had a MOBA itch recently. For reference, I played DOTA and DOTA 2 seriously for years - probably 1500+ hours between the two in my teens and early 20s, but it's been a long time since I've played them. HotS seems more my speed at my current statge of life, but I'm not sure the best way to learn these days?"

heroesofthestorm,Azshara would be the perfect next release.,"Really, she would be. I know Warcraft releases are (were) common, but her abilities in WoW and lore are very distinct from all of the releases within the past *several* years.

Azshara's boss fights, both of them, have been about minion summoning, positioning and crowd control effects. Our last summoner character was Probius back in 2017. Our last positioning centric character was Alexstraza back in 2017 as well, though an argument could be made for Anduin, and our last CC centric non-tank was Kel'Thuzad, back in 2017. Bit of a pattern there. Our last Shield centric character is all the way back in 2016 with Zarya as well (or Fenix in 2018 but that's self only). Additionally, she can largely be assembled out of existing abilities.

Looking through Azshara's bossfights, she could easily have CC's that force enemies to spread or group (Decree, Hand of the Queen). Team buffs that encourage her team to stand in a specific location (Font of Power). Mine placement (Arcane Orb), summoning (So very many examples). Shields (Warbringers cinematic, Shroud of Luminosity) and of course, arcane attacks.

--------------------------

As a sample setup, she could easily have

Q: Depth Orb. Multiple charges. Places a highly visible mine that detonates when walked into.

W: Beckon. Set a mark on an enemy hero that, after a delay, causes them to walk towards Azshara.

E: Legion of the Deep. Summons a Naga Royal Guard behind someone to attack them. Big beefy boy who can bodyblock. High armor but low HP.

D: Shroud of Luminosity. Passively grant shields to self and nearby allies (including summons/minions)

---------------------

That's just a sample kit. Honestly there's so many ways they could go with her, and they'd all be extremely distinct from the rest of the roster, especially the recent roster. Most of the game's summoners have been in since launch, we've only really got one character who uses mines. Mind Control is an effect currently exclusively used by Sylvanas. With the changes to Tassadar, shield granting characters are surprisingly rare. Azshara has the potential for all of that, effectively filling a massive amount of holes all in one character.

I get people want the Overmind and such, and you know, that would actually be pretty awesome too. But Azshara's got so much potential that I can't help but feel she'd be the perfect release at this point. Also, you know, so many assets they could reuse. Like, pull the Naga Royal Guard from WC3 Reforged. Because you might as well use those assets."
heroesofthestorm,If Falstad is going to be reworked/buffed can we at least nerf his gust?,"Gust is one of the strongest heroics in the game, and the 20 upgrade will sometimes just daze lock people instantly winning fights. It was fine on older Falstad but now that his PvE is much more baseline and w build is absurd outside of coordinated (and aa really good in coordinated) it's just to much. 

Or hey nerfing aa and removing the extra range and resets from w build would work as well. He'd still be decent in team fights, w feels less impossible to deal with for a lot of chars, have decent PvE and 2 great utilities in global + gust.


A bit (lot actually lol) of a personal tangent, I'm really annoyed they made w build so absurd it feels like some heroes literally can't do anything. In other bad hero matchups it feels possible to outplay the opponent. W build though is if you can't cc + mobility out or combo him through his team you just die, it doesn't matter if you're better unless the Falstad is horrible because it's impossible to outplay it unless he is greedy. Even if you get out of it it's a long range point and click low cd ability that chunks you and zones you out. Maybe it's fine in coordinated where teams will stop him instantly (which I don't think a ranged point and click should do but whatever) but for casual players it feels completely miserable being melee because you can't be in a long range around him because your team can't do perfect cc 100-0s in 2 seconds and if you try and don't pull it off he E's out to the edge of his w range, kills you while you can't touch him, and resets for the next person. I honestly feel like I'd survive a 16 zera easier then a 13 falstad because zera has to actually get in melee meaning you can actually hit him back as melee and you can actually dodge his w. 

But uh yeah main point is that gust shouldn't be on a hero that's great all around. Also can the weird daze lock be removed or fixed? Sometimes people are caught in it despite not being pushed into a wall and just get stuck for the first half of it. I assume it's because of the slow stopping you from fully leaving the kb range but I'm just guessing. (Also not sure what to flair it so I put it as discussion, maybe suggestion was better?)"
heroesofthestorm,Leaver penalty,"This is not the first time for me as it happened to my friends before, when you queue for ranked you alt tab since sometimes it takes 15min to find a match, so this morning I started to queue and after 5 min the game auto tabed just to show me leaver status, now I have to play something that I am not interested in, I have to win and also lost valuable ranked points for no reason at all, it is easy to see how terrible and flawed the system is, I know people that left the game forever just for this reason."
heroesofthestorm,Good and bad maps for heroes,"Good maps are maps in which the hero performs exceptionally well. If the hero doesn't have an

exceptionally good map, bad maps are listed instead. Not all heroes have good nor bad maps, some

heroes perform about the same in all maps. Good maps are only relatively good compared to other

heroesofthestorm,Returning player. What's the state of the game?,"So it's been about 12-18 months since I played, last. I think I stopped right before Mei was released. How are things these days? Has anything drastically changed?

As far as heroes, how are Deathwing and Diablo doing? These are the heroes I tried to play the most, especially in QM."
heroesofthestorm,Yrel,"I'm already level 10 with her and love basically everything about her - the character, her traits, channeling, the fact that she can be a bruiser, tank and even a minor healer.

One thing I dislike about her is how they made her into some religious zealot genocidical angel, while in the original Warcraft universe the Draenei's were friendly, sympathetic aliens who were trying to find peace and harmony in the world they lived. It often feels like playing some nazi female officer obliberating and punishing everything around her.

I think it'd have been better if they made her ""more Draenei"" and ""less killer Angel"" imo - I can play Johanna or Imperius if I feel fascistic (obvious /s)"
heroesofthestorm,Anduins Lightbomb: A Retrospective,"One year ago exactly I made a post suggesting a slight buff to it by reducing the amount of time it takes to go off by like .1 second (from 1.25 to 1.15 I think) as it felt bad for me to use and I’d like to say, I was wrong. One year ago I was just starting with him and hadn’t realized exactly how strong Lightbomb actually is. After making that post I actually started using it way more, I’m still not the best at it but have gotten some great moments that I couldn’t have happen without that ultimate. The ult, while I still whiff occasionally, is definitely not in need of a buff as I thought. Granted I kinda wish it had a direct 20 talent but I do see why it doesn’t, it’s really good when 1: The enemy has lots of CC and you can’t reliably use Salvation or 2: You have a team that can use it as a main way of CC. 

I just want to say, while I didn’t get much on it to replies, thanks for helping me get better at one of my favorite characters even if not directly."
heroesofthestorm,Search terms for Heroes inside the store or character select.,"Have you ever searched for something in the Heroes Store or character select and was surprised that it didn't come up but you found it under a different search term?

If you have a moment let me know what those are.  Thanks for playing!"
heroesofthestorm,Why don't we have an Ability Draft yet?,"The title really says it all.

**UPDATE:** In hindsight, the title didn't really *say it all*, did it? My bad! I started with DOTA back in 2003, so it's easy to forget that not everyone is as familiar with the genre. **Ability Draft is where you get a random hero, but draft your abilities**. So you might make a hero with all lifesteal, or a combo of % damage, etc. For anyone who enjoys ARAM/brawl, you would love it.

I definitely understand the budget and time constraints (software engineer here), especially on an game that is all but sunsetted. Their development framework may not be anywhere close to capable of supporting this out-of-the-box, and might require some pretty hefty surgery to get it working. Not to mention, I haven't really thought about it critically enough regarding talents and stuff."
heroesofthestorm,Overwhelming Affliction not healing %hp damage to Deathwing feels like an oversight.,"Title oops: ~~healing~~ **dealing**

___

**[1] Overwhelming Affliction:** Enemy Heroes with 3 stacks of Banshee's Curse are Slowed by 15%. Sylvanas's Basic Attacks against Slowed enemy Heroes deal 1% of their maximum Health as damage.

Since DW is permanently unstoppable, the %hp part of the talent never affects him. A fix could be changing it to ""Sylvanas' Basic Attacks against Slowed enemy Heroes, or enemy heroes with three stacks of Banshee's Curse, ...""

PS: Another OA oversight since we're on the topic: [Remorseless neither applies, nor extends an already active Overwhelming Affliction.](https://old.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/kwqqmf/sylvanas_remorseless_neither_applies_nor_extends/)"
heroesofthestorm,Feedback of my experience with the game,"By this communities standards, I'm new to the game. My account is kind of old because I've been playing very sparsely over the course of a few years now, but recently, I've decided that I want to enjoy something more casual than dota, and so I've started playing HotS more with the intention of learning the game and trying to play it well. As part of that endeavor, I thought I would post some feedback about it that I haven't seen here before. I have 3.3k hours in dota, so I'm going to draw some comparisons there.

Pros:

1. **Heroes are very unique.** Dota heroes are unique as well, but many heroes in this game are crazy and I'm here for it.
2. **There's never downtime.** This has downsides, but they are for a different category. I love how there are always multiple objectives you can go for, and its' not trivial to know what the right one is.

Neutral:

1. Having so many different maps is interesting, but all of the heroes arent balanced for all of the maps. I know a lot of people wont consider that a con, but finding matches in draft modes takes way longer than quick queue, so it is a con if you pick a hero and get put in a map that that hero is weaker in.
2. Heroes sharing XP is interesting. I hated it when I started playing, but I'm warming up to it now. I like the idea that if you are 4v5ing the enemy team, and you have 1 player soaking and pushing that you are getting a huge advantage if you can keep that up. That is very cool, but I still don't love how one team suddenly gets a huge power spike simultaneously. I think its kind of cool in dota whenever a hard carry has been ignored for like 20 minutes and comes out of the jungle as a God after his team has been suffering. That gives you cool moments too.

Bad:

1. **Learning what heroes are capable of doing is impossible in game!** Tbh, this is the real reason that I wrote this post. I love the *concept* of talents in this game as a replacement for items, but it is fucking impossible to learn what characters are capable of doing because the talent tree for every character is humongous and the text on a ton of the talents is like 2-3 paragraphs long, and the game is too fast paced for you to read the talents in that menu while its going on, and you can't click on other player's characters to read what their abilities do. I know that this is going to get eye rolls as someone coming from dota, which is also fairly complicated, but in dota, most of the learning in the game comes from figuring out what you are immune to when you have spell immunity turned on (which is admittedly a convoluted mess). In dota, as a brand new player, you will get rolled over and over again, but while your dead, you can select the enemy hero and read their abilities and items to learn why you died, and after playing 1 game with a necrophos, you will know everything that necrophos does.  
In this game, you can't select heroes to read their abilities and because of that, it feels impossible to learn what characters do while you are in game. If you gave me a quiz at the end of the game about what Kael'thas (who has been in like the past 20 of my 30 games probably) does, I'd probably fail. ""Does Kaelthas have a slow?"" ""Idk, I think he might have a talent that makes it so that after his tornado puts you down, your slowed for a few seconds. I think that might have happened to me before."" I ofc think it was the right move to remove items in this game, but why couldn't the talent trees have been trimmed to like 2 choices at every level, and then come up with some kind of visual language in the talent tree so that you can know what its going to do just by looking at it. For example, create an icon that represents increased range, and whenever there's a talent that increases the range of a spell, it is just the spell icon with that range icon on top of it so that you don't need to read 2 paragraphs about how every time you use X spell and hit hits 3 or more heroes, then it gains +2 damage, except if one of those heroes is diablo themed. And once you've increased your damage to +36, then all of your spells change colors, and cause enemy units hit by them to teleport to a random spot 50 units away from where they currently are. The opposition to this post is likely going to be that characters' identities would get removed by simplifying the talents, but I totally disagree. The nuance of the talents in almost every case does not justify how difficult they are to learn. Any talents that are complex, but are an integral part of the hero should probably get moved into the heroes kit so that the talents can be simplified.
2. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Fun game. If anyone has third party apps that let you select heroes to read their abilities, and puts the selected talents that affect those abilities as tooltips onto the ability descriptions themselves, I would be very grateful to have access to that. I don't want to have to research what heroes do out of game. I didn't have to in dota, and I don't want to here."

The current state of the game is full of quest based talents whether baseline or talented.  Also we have heroes who literally get stronger by scale exponentially as the game goes along by hitting or getting kills, such as Zuljin, Raynor, Butcher, and Artanis.  

Not only do early deaths feed the overall power scaling of your enemy throughout the game, it also gives xp talent leads to your enemy, leading to more deaths, which scale your enemy's power even higher exponentially.  Let's not forget that being behind talents because of feeding generally demoralizes your teammates and make it more likely you die in team fights as well, further scaling up your enemies.   

And since early deaths &amp; hits scale your enemy's power exponentially throughout the match, it also directly leads to more LATE GAME deaths.  So in fact, early deaths make late deaths MORE LIKELY, and thus I say early deaths are actually WORSE than late deaths overall."

heroesofthestorm,How do I get out of bronze?,"Does anyone have any tips for how to carry games in ranked? Im so unbelievably hardstuck bronze I'm at a loss for how to progress forward. I've tried playing carry heros and impact tanks and flexing but I seriously just cant break out.

&amp;#x200B;

Most MOBAs I have played I typically play around plat level. I dont think Im HOTS plat but Im not new to basic concepts like positioning and when to soak vs push objectives and camps etc. When I was placed into silver I was fine with it because thats probably right about where my skill level was. Now after about 50 games I've gone down. The rank doesnt matter to me, its more so that the farther down bronze I go the more toxic the players are. The more often I run into people who int after going 0-1 in the opening mid fight. Its so hard to not get frustrated at people constantly harassing each other even when youre winning.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thats enough pity and woe is me. Does anyone have any tips for actually climbing out? I feel like hots is so much harder to carry in without the ability to get super fed and 1v5 a team as a carry. Like I said Im not going to pretend like Im good and all my team mates are bad - I make mistakes and I try to learn from them, I just feel so stuck compared to any other game in this genre Ive played and Im at such a loss the enjoyment is starting to fade which is a real shame.

Any recommendations are appreciated."

heroesofthestorm,[Hero Idea] Another Diablo Barbarian," Was bored. Didn't really feel like playing. Had some fun in my head. Hope you enjoy.

Also I was recently playing Diablo 3 as barb. There are a lot of skills that were not included in Sonya's kit and I feel they suit well enough to make another character based on Diablos interpretation.

This bard should be suited to fit a tank role. And I'm sure he is overpowered but atleast I included some fresh ideas that could be used in another hero design...atleast that's what I think.

**ScarBird The Barbarian**

He is supposed to look like a male character from D3. An older but bulky man with grey hair and beard. 2handed axe is a must have just to make him distinct from Sonya.  
Name is...whatever. I have chosen ScarBird because he should focus on taking damage(Scar) and making use of barb's shouts(Bird).

 Health- 2700

 Rage- 100

 Unit Radius-0.8125 (Arthas’ size)

 Attack Type- Melee

 Attack Damage-125

 Attack Speed- 1.0 (once per sec)

Passive: **Steel Fury**

 Use Fury instead of mana. Making a basic attack grants 10 armor for 4 seconds.

 \*Basic attacks generate 8 fury( which is more than Sonya’s 6 )

 \*Every damage taken generates 2 fury points( just like Sonya )

 \*Armor stacks with other sources of armor but not with itself

 \~Scarbird is barbarian thus I think he could have some similarities with Sonya. Only difference is that   
 Scarbird gains armor that should suit a tank character.

Q: **Earth Shake**

 After 0.5 of cast time. Scarbird shakes earth around him with 4.5 radius( Anduin’s Lbomb ). Earthshake   
 deals 56 dmg leaving earthshaken ground. When Scarbird leaves earthshaken area, it erupts dealing   
 112 dmg and stunning every foe  inside for 1 seconds.

 \*8 seconds of cooldown but cooldown starts counting after the eruption.

 \*Earthshaken ground stays until eruption.

 \*Death is equal to leaving the area.

 \*Earthshake has a 30 rage cost.

 \~A weaker version of Light Bomb to help Scarbird with engaging and disengaging the fight.

W: **Shout!**

 Scarbird makes a battle shout. Shout deals 34 dmg to enemies around him ( 6 radius ). Scarbird gains   
 a shield that absorbs up to 350 dmg over the next 4 seconds.

 \*4 seconds cooldown

 \*50 rage cost

 \~This skill will have some customization in talents, it’s supposed to be underwhelming without lvl 4.

E: **Furious Charge**

 Scarbird runs in a straight line, dealing 100 damage to each enemy. Gains 5 rage for every enemy he   
 hits, doubled against heroes. Shout! reduces cooldown by 3 seconds.

 \*15 seconds cooldown

 \*No rage cost

 \~It’s a mobility tool. Provides Scarbird with some engage that’s necessary for a tank.

Heroic 1: **Molten Fury(Earthquake)**

 **Passive**: Scarbird generates 3 points of fury every second.

 **Active**: Scarbird spends all of his fury to make a small leap to target location( max range of Valla’s E ).   
 Leap creates a rupture( 3 radius) around the targeted location. Rupture spits fire every second that   
 deals 60 damage to each enemy inside. Damage is increased by 10% for every second Molten Fury   
 stays active. Rupture stays on the ground for 4 seconds and 1 more second for every 10 points of rage   
 spent on this ability.

 \*90 seconds cooldown

 \*Spends every ten points of rage but leaves the rest.

 \~A powerful zoning tool. Can be used to discourage the enemy team from passing chokepoints. Can   
 be placed on top of your carries to help with peeling. Could be a different shape( an “X” or straight line) but circle is easiest to describe.

Heroic 2: **Rend**

 Scarbird makes a sweeping strike in a small half-circular area in front of him. Each enemy hero hit   
 loses 15% of their max hp over the next 6 seconds. Scarbird is healed for 75% of this value.

 \*2 Charges

 \*No rage cost

 \*40 seconds of cooldown per charge

 \*If Rend damage is active, using second Rend on the same target refreshes the duration instead of   
 increasing damage.

 \~Self-healing for a tank is always handy. Should help when you want to stay in a fight for longer.

**TALENTS:**

**LVL 1:**

 \~This tier is all about how you generate rage points from your basic attacks.

 **Frenzy**\- Increases attack speed by 25%. Basic attacks give 10 points of rage instead of 8.

 **Cleave**\- Basic attacks cleave in semicircle in front of Scarbird. Gain 6 points of rage for additional hero   
 hit and 1 point for every non-hero.

 **Throw Weapon(Active)**\- Scarbird throws an axe in a straight line. When axe hits it deals 150 damage   
 and provides 20 points of rage. Throw Weapon is considered as a basic attack for passive calculation.

 \*6 second cooldown

 **Bash**\- Every third attack deals bonus 50% damage, and slows by 10% for 2 seconds.

 Hitting slowed enemies with basic attack provides 3 more rage points.

**LVL 4:**

  \~ This tier is all about giving your Shout! an additional effect to precise Scarbirds gameplay. Each   
  talent from this tree provides bonus effect at lvl 20.

  **War Cry(W)**\- Your allies are also affected by Shout! shield.

  At lvl 20 Scarbird gains PROTECTED for 1 second.

  **Threatening Shout(W)**\- All enemies affected by Shout! deal reduced damage by 30%.

  At lvl 20 also taunts every enemy in 3.5 radius for 1.25 seconds.

  **Battle Rage(W)**\- You gain 20% attack speed and movement speed for 4 seconds. Reduce Shout! cost   
  to 40 rage points.

  At lvl 20 your allies are also affected by this buff.

**LVL 7**:

 **Tough as nails**:Whenever you lose 5% of your health( from multiple sources ). You deal 26 damage to   
 every enemy nearby.( 3.5 radius like every sunfire effect in the game )  


 **Brawler(Passive)**: Steel Fury provides 3 more points of bonus armor for every hero nearby.

 **Juggernaut(Active)**:  Reduce duration of Stuns, Slows and Roots by 75% for the next 4 seconds.

**LVL 13**:

 **Battering Ram(E)**: Furious Charge provides CC immunity for the duration of charge.

 **Dreadnought(E)**: Furious Charge gains second charge. Basic attacks reduce Furious Charge cooldown   
 by 2 seconds.

 \*Cooldown between every use of Furious Charge is 3 seconds.

 **Tremors(Q)**: Earthshaken ground deals 26 damage per second and slows by 20%. Eruption also slows   
 by 40% for 2 seconds.

 **Pound of Flesh**: You can activate your passive ability to spend all of your rage and heal 0.4% of your   
 health for every rage point spent. Increase max hp by 300 points(not scalling). 

 \*Cooldown 40 seconds

**LVL 16**:

 **Grab(E)**: Scarbird grabs the first enemy he hits by Furious Charge, deals 50% bonus damage and   
 drags him along charge duration. If Scarbird hits the wall, he stuns grabbed enemy for 1 second.

 **Tectonic Rift(Q)**: Earth Shake radius is increased by 20%. Eruption deals 100% more damage and   
 stuns for bonus 0.5 second to enemies hit by it’s center.

 **Unforgiving(Passive)**: Rage cannot fall under 30 points of rage.

 \*In practice it can reduce rage cost by up to 30 points. While providing full effect for H1.

 **Berserker Rage(Passive)**: For every second Steel Fury is active you gain 3% increase to basic attack   
 damage up to 30%. Bonus is lost when Steel Fury expires.

**LVL 20**:  
 **Relentless Fire**(H1): Molten Fury radius increases by 5% every second.  


 **Blood Lust(H2)**: Rend healing increased to 125% of damage dealt. Basic attacks against target that   
 suffers from Rend increase Rend duration by 1 second.

 \*That increases damage by \~2.5% of enemy hp.

 **Weapon Master**: Gain each lvl 1 talent.

 **Ignore Pain(Active)**: Activate to gain 60 armor for 4 seconds.

 \~Straight out of Sonya’s lvl 20 \^\^"
heroesofthestorm,I need a mentor to help get me out of Diamond,"I’m a pretty good player, particularly on heroes I play a lot, but my skill set extends almost entirely to microgame.  That is to say:  I know how and when to make trades, where to position during a fight to maximize dps/healing and minimize damage taken, and how every ability in the game interacts.  I consistently have top scores for my position, be it healing or damage, but I also know that isn’t the biggest key to winning games.

What I severely lack is macrogame knowledge.  I know camps are important, but I don’t know when to take them.  I know some objectives should be forfeited, but I don’t know how to make that call.  I know sometimes soaking is better than a fight, but I don’t know for how long.

Basically, I’m looking for a higher ranked player to tell me what to do and explain their decisions.  Failing that, if anybody knows a good streamer that is vocal in why they’re making their decisions, I could see that being a huge resource."

heroesofthestorm,How do I deal with this specific team comp,"Map: Battlefield of Eternity

Enemy team:

4-man: Mei, Malfurion, Valla and Zul'jin

My team:

4-man: ETC, Raynor, Reghar and Guldan (Me)

I picked last on the draft and normally I wanted to go Alarak (my main). Thou the team suggested that we should pick a ranged hero in the last few seconds so I picked Guldan to clear wave fast and apply pressure on their structure. Thou my choice was completely wrong. Thinking about it now, Mephisto would have been a much better pick but I am very uncertain if it would have been enough to have a chance against their comp anyway.

This is why I want to get others opinions on the subject because I think that maybe this newly empowered combo (thanks to the new talent Emerald Dreams) might be under the radar right now or I am just missing knowledge on the draft. Whatever the answer is, I think is it worth the conversation.

Malfurion with the new talent at 1 giving 2sec sleep + Mei Blizzard completely shutted down our team. We basically couldn't do anything and we lost at the second objective.

The two AA heroes would apply so much pressure on our tank that we had to back off at our gate. Then, Malfurion root + 2sec and Mei Blizzard made our gate a death zone. The combo of those 2 skills made it easy to isolate someone and give them a 3.25 sec to repositioning themselves to take out the isolated hero our just turn the fight into a 4v5.

Is there something that I am missing because I feel this comp is very strong right now and especially on this particular map. What kind of team should we have drafted against them or should I just ban Malfurion on this map every time. What you guys think about it?"
heroesofthestorm,Losing matches i should win,"Another question for the community, that as a new player I'm having a hard time to understand.
Little background, usually play bruiser's, with good waveclear and fight capabilities ( sonya, dva, malthael, artanis, thrall )
Thing is, i do rarely lose a lane. I'm usually on top of exp meter, do focus on soaking, sometimes double soaking and doing camps when the opportunity calls, ending with sometimes 7 to 10 camps.

But even with exp advantage i lose the match. After lvl 13, when the TFs are more often, it's over.
When my team is superior to the enemies it's a total domination, but when my team is at least slightly inferior because of matchup, counter's or even skill, usually i end up losing.

So my question is, how do one keep winning in those cases? I can't feel the snowball effect of early macro domination and superior experience, even being 1 or 2 lvls ahead is not enough. I feel that is really hard to be able to turn around bad TFs on this game and i end up dying a lot, obviously giving away any advantage we had before.

Example 1: Yesterday with Artanis on hanamura, we got a fairly decent team, Artanis/Samuro/Anduin/Liming/Muradin. The enemy Chogall/Auriel/Cassia/Valeera. I dominated macro up until lvl 16, stole 2 bosses from they, while doing every single one for us, and stole turret camp 3 times. We were 2 lvls ahead ( 3 in one moment ), but Chogall was delaying us, it always took us too much time to kill him before we could push. We managed to get 1 inside fort, and almost won.
Up until we started losing TFs, at lvl 20. I decided to give up on camps and push and try to stay with the team more so we could turn it around again, but it was not enough, valeera and chogall destroyed liming on every fight without much to do, ended up losing at the same lvl, and felt completely useless at the end seeing how liming exploded every fight.
Example 2: today, sky temple, Malthael/Varian/Nazeebo/Liming/Anduin vs Ragnaros/Valeera/Auriel/Sylvannas/Blaze.
Same as before, got vs Raggy on top lane, dominated him even getting 2 early kills, got 7 camps, only managed to steal bruiser camp 1 time ( hate this map, is too big ).
We got 1 inside fort and left the other 2 at 5% hp while still having our 3. The issue was that we couldn't win TFs, this was a QM and we didn't had any disable, so Varian was getting destroyed, and i couldn't get in because they always saved silence for me.
I feel that i lost this match myself, trying to TF, is backdooring a possible solution? Maybe i should had continue to push?

This is repeated a lot by myself, but can't figure my mistakes.

TLDR: i suck at late game decision's and can't find a guide to clear it. If your team is inferior and can't win TFs even being ahead in lvl, what's the solution for a solo queuer playing mostly bruiser's?

heroesofthestorm,Kharazim's Insight should not be a Quest,"One of the best design decisions of the past year has been to prune quests. From Xul's cooldown reduction on his Q, to Malthael's Throwing Shade, many heroes have had their abilities given to them straight up rather than being forced to go thru a tedious set of tasks to get them.

But one Quest that still sticks out like a sore thumb is Kharazim's [[Insight]]. It asks Khara to lane or take camps to best complete the quest—something he shouldn't be doing in the early game—and thereby rewards play counter to the character's role.

I don't know if just starting the game with Insight completed would be too broken. But I do think that either a watered-down version should be given gratis with no quest factor at all, or the quest itself should be changed to something more appropriate to Kharazim's role, like hit 20 Heroes with his W. I think removing the quest altogether would be the cleanest option, but there might be something interesting to an alternate completion factor too.

TL;DR: Insight is a poorly designed quest, and should be changed to just give some form of the bonus like Reaper's Toll and Throwing Shade were"

I'm seeking some advice here on talent choices for tanks and bruisers. I find myself almost always choosing the regen (hp/s) talents when available, but wanted to know what the community has to say about those.

Do you find them useful in general or rather underwhelming when compared to their alternatives? Are they good on some heroes only and useless on others? Do you feel that the heals brought by these talents are substantials?

I feel that they are not optimal (and they are often not recommended on icyveins) but I can't turn my head around the fact that they are available early and in a prolonged team fight, this regen can add up to quite a lot and save your butt.

Example for these talents are the following :

Anub'arak lvl 1 : Regeneration master  
Dehaka lvl 1 : Tissue regeneration  
Johanna lvl 1 : Law of hope  
Ragnaros lvl 4 : Catching fire  
Rexxar lvl 4 : Hunter gatherer

heroesofthestorm,"Sorry, but Falstat is insanely broken RN.","I ran into a couple of random Falstats on the weekend, and my bruiser and tank allies begin to cry/complain that the Falstat is melting them. We lost those couple of games, and I didnt manage to guess why.

&amp;#x200B;

I proceed to take him to Try mode, and equip the ""W"" build... Guess what? The ""W"" does over 3500 damage at level 20 on its own if left for the full duration when fully stacked(And the radius is long, its not easy to get away fast from his skill). Over 3500 !!! And again: Thats the ""W"" alone, not counting Falstat's solid AAs, and so on.

This week, I suddenly begin to run into A LOT of them in SL (In average elo, Im Gold ATM), all with ""W"" build, of course. I played different heroes/roles and maps in the games against the random Falstats, and they had a lot of presence every fight. The games we lost we felt totally powerless, and the games we won were very very close games.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were to tell me some years ago ""Falstat will be OP"", I would laugh in your face... Facepalm.

... And of course, he is now my permaban.

heroesofthestorm,Illidan Gameplay and Commentary Video,"[gameplay and commentary video ](https://youtu.be/c20WbBTSltg).  

This game highlights how I try to use Illidan to kill n chill.  Or more specifically, how I prioritize killing zagara creep over pretty much anything else.  

Note, that I'm typically pretty bad with Illidan often and that's why I call this a commentary and not a guide.  I discuss my gameplay and chosen abilities but I definitely don't claim to be a pro Illidan player!  In fact, I died a lot in this game, but I had some fun so there's that.    

Talents used in this game.   
1:  Unending Hatred.  
4:  Rapid Chase.  
7:  Hunter's Onslaught.  
10: The Hunt.  
13:  Elusive Strike.  
16:  Fiery Brand.  
20:  Nowhere to Hide."
heroesofthestorm,Abuse Chat Reports,"Abusive chat reports should only be validated for hate speech or excessive profanity usage. “You suck” or “You threw this” should not qualify as abuse text chat. It is absolutely absurd that players can intentionally throw games and hit 16 deaths in a ranked match, and not be penalized, yet you can lose your account for telling someone they’re bad in ARAM. Banning is useful to remove players who negatively impact the game in a way that is uncontrollable to the player. For example, reporting someone for feeding, doesn’t make them stop feeding. However, reporting someone for abusive chat automatically blocks them. Bam, problem solved. It’s silly how aggressive the automated system is against abusive text bans when the player has complete control over who’s messages they see. Outside of hate speech, excessive profanity, threats of violence, or any actual abusive chat, bans should not be valid. 

Yes I was just banned for telling someone that their pick was responsible for losing an ARAM match. Yes I know ARAM is meaningless. No, I did not use any profanity or aggressive language. I plainly said, your pick lost the game, you should have picked this other hero. It is absurd that this type of interaction could result in an account suspension.

Edit, I received a list of my offenses, I’ll provide them below: 

""you shoulda let me play ming instead and you heal if you were gonna quit like a lil bitch""
This was in response to someone quitting during a match and intentionally throwing. This player refused to heal, and started throwing within the first couple minutes because the game wasn’t going well. So tell me, what’s more destructive, this person throwing the game because they’re upset, or my response? 

""fuck this guy""
This was in response to someone intentionally feeding because they wanted another team member to apologize to them for saying they sucked. One of our teammates said ‘everyone&gt;you’ and this player started throwing saying “apologize to me or I’ll keep throwing”. So my response is listed above. I also said we don’t negotiate with terrorists. Yet I’m the one with the suspension. 

""why are you a loser""
 This was in response to another playing being toxic to me. Another player was bad mouthing me and being toxic to me, using profanities and homophobic hate speech. This was my response to them. Yet I’m the one with a suspension. 

This is what I’m talking about. This is ridiculous."
heroesofthestorm,Quick chat commands,"Online games have had this for decades, and I think it would be a great idea to add them to this game.

Generally, pings are good enough for conveying basic information about the map, where you're going, and where the enemy might be, but there are limitations to the information that pings can convey. Plus, as we all know, people often ignore pings because they either don't understand what it was for, or they disagree with what they believe you're trying to get across.

I've had several bad experiences with pings. Here are some examples.

* In most leagues pinging somebody on your own team is effectively ""calling them out"" for something bad that they did. Almost never have I seen ""Player X notes that Hero Y needs help!"" be used for that purpose. Conversely, pinging someone after they make a good play is also non-verbal communication for ""Good job"". I've seen this go horribly wrong. Sometimes I ping someone after they save me or make a great kill, and they immediately open with a tirade of foul language because they think I'm insulting them in some way
* Traps. Getting 4 other people to understand that you're trying to set a trap with an ""On my way"" ping is almost impossible
* Apologies. Apologies can diffuse a potentially ugly situation where you make a mistake and are about to get flamed for it. A simple ""mb"" or ""sorry"" can be enough to convey this, but pings offer nothing for that
* Anyone who plays with team chat off can't say ""GG"" at the end of the game - sometimes it'd be nice to do so

Adding the ability to quickly print out a message to your team has a lot of benefits:

* Being able to convey more information, in situations such as above
* Game quality may increase as people will spend less time typing
* Players with team chat disabled can still use these commands to help their team without needing to read team chat
* It would have restrictions on the volume of usage to prevent spam, and of course if it is abused you can still mute that person's chat, just like you would with pings
* Silenced players will be able to contribute, but with the same restrictions as they have with pings
* Let's be honest, people pay much less attention to pings than they should and used to. Simulating actual human interaction has psychological benefits that people are more likely to show interest in
* Toxicity is almost certain to go down as arguments will be reduced

So how would it work? Hotkeys! A limited number of predefined phrases can be bound to a few hotkeys, let's say 5 or 6 of them. They could default to num pad 4 through 9, or maybe F5 through F10. They can be rebound to whatever you like; even mouse buttons if you have them. And you can bind the 5-6 most important ones, or the ones you use the most.

As for some suggestions, perhaps you can all help define some of the most important ones, but to start with we could have something like:

* Good job!
* Set a trap?
* Sorry!
* Good idea
* I don't think so
* I need stacks
* I've got this
* Thanks!
* No problem
* GG!

How do you feel about it? There's probably improvements that can be made to the suggestion but as a concept I think it would be great. I'd certainly like it as I usually play with team chat turned off."

heroesofthestorm,Is there a spreadsheet of hero damage that shows scaling from 1-20+ ?,"I thought at some point I saw a spreadsheet of basic auto attack damage for heroes, but I can’t find the link"
heroesofthestorm,This game is 10x more enjoyable when you have access to all the heroes.,"I have a level \~250 account. On it I have managed to get 22 heroes, which is fine, but as someone who mostly plays Quick Match, the recent Blizzcon promotion with all heroes available has been amazing. It takes a LOT of playing to get 10k gold for just one new hero. I know most people have level 1000+ accounts and this isn't an issue for them, but I think if the game does want to ever attract new players having all heroes available is a must. 

I totally understand they need/want to make money still, and that's hard when new skins rarely come, but I know I'll be playing a lot less when it goes back to normal."
heroesofthestorm,Lili doesn't always need Serpent Sidekick,"After [the patch](https://heroespatchnotes.com/hero/lili.html) I see it's very popular for Lili to take the Cloud Serpent (W) talents, buffing 1 teammate with healing, damage, healing amp, and movespeed.  And apparently, she always also takes Serpent Sidekick (lev 1) for reduced W cooldown, so all those other bonuses can be used more often.  People take either every W talent, or none of them.  But I suggest taking a minute before playing Lili to consider if another lev 1 talent could be better.

Lili's lev 1 options are **Serpent Sidekick** (W cooldown when damaged), **Free Drinks** (Q cooldown if target low health), and **Eager Adventurer** (QWE cooldown for 1.5 sec after the normal 1 sec bonus ends).  (All options also have a mana benefit, which can be ignored).  The key shortcoming of Serpent Sidekick is that you can't put 2 W on one hero.

Serpent Sidekick has less value if:

* Your job is to support just one important hero, probably someone with low health and high damage like Valla, Kerrigan, Tracer, or Orphea.   (Or Garrosh?) An extra serpent won't assist your main hypercarry, but Free Drinks Q cooldown might.  (Notice synergy between Q cooldown and healing amp from Blessing of Wulong)
* Lili is alone for some reason.  She's not supposed to solo lane, but it happens.  Or she needs to stall an objective 1v3.
* Lili doesn't get attacked.  Serpent Sidekick cooldown will only work if Lili was damaged in the past 1 sec.  Eager Adventurer still works if damaged less often, and Free Drinks is when a teammate was damaged.
* The Lili player clicks wrong.  It's possible to make a mistake in choosing where to put the extra W serpent, or to miss the timing and not get optimal value.

Anyhow, please try Free Drinks or Eager Adventurer with your Serpent build."

heroesofthestorm,A lesson - Mistakes you're probably making with or against Orphea.,"Hey everyone. First things first: I've been playing HotS since the alpha, and am playing at master mmr.

I've been playing Orphea on a spree lately. I've clocked over 100 games on her the past 2 months, and I have some thoughts on her after studying her playstyle, but also how other people play her. Her winrate is at a healthy 49.4% according to Heroesprofile, so she's a good place according to Blizzard.

Here are some of the things I've learned playing Orphea lately:

* Yes, she is incredibly strong. I exclusively play the same build  \[T3312223,Orphea\] and currently have a 64% winrate over 100 games.
* She definitely has weaknesses: mainly stuns and blinds. But I want you teach you how to overcome these weaknesses.
   * All hard CC has cooldown or some other delay (think Muradin AA stun talent)
   * Although it will seem unnatural and bad macro: **arrive at fights a little late**. Let Muradin use his stun, let Varian use his taunt, let Cassia use her blind, let KTZ use his combo, let Alarak use his combo... That's when you come in and can wreck the whole enemy team with your Q (for reset) and consant melee W hits (2 second CD with lvl 7 talent, huge heal and shield from lvl 13).
      * That doesn't mean that you should let your team just die before you engage: you have to learn to pick your moments. Learn how sustainable your team is to know how long you can wait with engaging with your W.
      * The morale of the story is: without enemy CC: you're almost unkillable from level 13 and on.
   * Apart from CC, she has a slight weakness against mobile heroes like Tracer, if they know how to dodge her W.  
* When playing against Orphea, keep this same lesson in mind. Especially if you see she's going Trait/W build \[T3312223,Orphea\], Save some of your CC to cancel her abilities, as both her Q and W have a cast time. 
* Secondly, you can ""counter"" her by looking whether she missed her abilities. Especially with this build, if she misses her W she is almost powerless for 10 seconds. In that regard, she is very similar to play against as \[T1211113,Imperius\]"
heroesofthestorm,Honest Qhira Rework Proposal,"Hi fellow Heroes,

&lt;&lt;I have been playing Hots (and mobas) for a long time, and no hero has resonated with me quite like Qhira has. She's everything I want in a hero, and especially during the Hero's Medallion event, it made practising with her that much more challenging, but ultimately that much more rewarding. I've really had a lot of time to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses in a lot of situations, as well as hear and see other people's frustrations with her, both playing as, with and against her. She has an insanely high skill cap, but I also feel that the skill floor for starting to play Qhira and learn her can be really frustrating. I know there are a handful of heroes who deserve a rework more, and many that need it more, but I wanted to speak from my heart and I am very enthusiastic about this and wanted to share it in hopes that maybe other's will agree with me, that some gentle tuning to Qhira's talents (not changing her abilities) will result in a lower skill floor, while not moving (or even potentially raising) the skill ceiling, while still putting a heavy emphasis on keeping her open to counter play.&gt;&gt;

TL;DR, here is a Qhira rework I've worked really hard on

Fixes:

\&gt; Q now hits any target in the line, including minions, monsters, mercs, as well as invisibile targets such as abathur mines and zagara creep

\&gt; E will connect with any target Hero that connects with the animation; not just the end tip of the sword

\&gt; E will also cancel the animation if the animation makes contact / crosses a Hero with an unstoppable effect that would (presently the animation continues and completes the full channel of the action, while simply passing through said hero, and no longer connecting with any other target as the skill has ""failed"")

\&gt; Hookshot is now 10% longer; Baseline hookshot gains 250% CDR if Qhira has not taken damage in 5 seconds.

\&gt; Added a function (Activate) baseline to the 1. key slot: Grip Stance - Toggle between swinging clockwise and counterclockwise (indicated with either red arrows spinging counterclockwise on the abilities icon, or green arrows spinning clockwise. Cannot be used while Sweeping Strike is Active. No Cooldown. (Credit to Wongerthanur for the concept!) 

Talents:

1 (Level 1) :

No changes

2 (Level 4) :

\&gt; Upstage - Landing Hookshot, Hitting a Hero with a single cast of Q 3 or more times, or Re-activating sweep will grant Qhira evasion on the next 1 Heroic Auto Attacks. No Duration. Stacks up to 3 times.

\&gt; Hunter's Tools (Remove Ensnaring Swing) - Reduce E's cooldown by 4 seconds; Increase hookshots CDR to 900% from 250% when not having taken damage for 5 seconds.

\&gt; Commanding Presence \[Active-30s\] (Remove Your Pain, My Gain) - Give Qhira 20 Armor for 2 seconds. All targets around her have their damage and move speed dropped by 20%. If 2 or more Heroes are affected, the effects and duration are doubled.

3 (Level 7) :

\&gt; Chainsaw (Remove The Thirst) - If Q hits 3 or more Heroic targets, Q's cooldown is reset. The next cast of Q will heal Qhira for 50% of the damage dealt.

\&gt; Healmonger - Unchanged

\&gt; Siphoning Link - Same ability; additional quest effect: each non-primary hero target hit by the tether of E while Qhira is sweeping increases the healing on Basic Attacks by 2%

4 (Level 10) : No Change

5 (Level 13) :

\&gt; String them Up! (Remove Chainsaw) - Every 4th cast of Q will be empowered to deal 100% bonus damage. This effect can empower Maximum Effort as well.

\&gt; Pulsing Pain - Non-primary targets hit by E take 115 (+4% per level) damage; this includes non-heroic targets.

\&gt; The Hunter - Unchanged

6 (Level 16) :

\&gt; Booming Kick - Unchanged

\&gt; Lingering Ailment - Armor reduction can stack up to 30; Lasts 3 seconds.

\&gt; Swing Life Away - +1 second to E sweep duration. +50% sweeping speed. - 2 seconds cooldown per non-primary heroic target hit by E.

7 (Level 20) :

\&gt; Silent Killer - Unchanged

\&gt; Unleashed Potential - Unchanged

\&gt; Utility Belt - Gives an additional charge of Hookshot; the initial impact of E still gives 1 charge

\&gt; No Sanctuary - No Change

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my proposal! I didn't want this to be any longer than it needed to be so I'll post a bit of an ""explanation behind my ideas"" separately. Much love and many thanks fellow Heroes! \~Flubbergushie"

heroesofthestorm,Sexism and Harrasment by a 3 stack in SL,"So my latest game in SL was very wierd. 

As soon as I joined draft a guy asked ""are you a woman""?Being 4 other people in the draft I guessed it wasn't directed to me. Soon I realised that guy was part of a 3 stack. Very chatty and one of them aggressive without reason. I was hovering Yrell and he prepicked thrall, when asked if he was solo lane or 4man, he answered ""I playwhat I want F****** noob!"".
The other 2 guys tried to keep it calm, and I saidit was fine, lets just play. Then added an smiling emoji, which came out with Yrell's face.

That's when they started asking ""are you a woman?"" again. Just in case the 5th player was feeling unconfortable I asked them to leave gender and sexual comments aside from the game and they didn't stop, so they directed them towards me.

I didn't care, and kept answering to focus, and just said ""I'm a gamer"", which looked like a confirmation to them. Things kept going in that line the whole game, and as we won, one of them wrote in french what google translated as ""at the end the F**ng dirty bitch didn't answer"".

Obviously I reported him and before blocking I wrote to him privately to expose his behaviour. 

Fuck this people. Seriously. If you see this behaviour even not directed at you, face it and confront it.

heroesofthestorm,Asking for help on Abathur,"I've been playing abathur and am trying to get better with him. I spend a good 99% of my time as a hat all across the map since being a shield and a relatively decent damage source has been really useful in the games I've played, but in all of the guides i've found for abathur they say that I can solo soak a lane. Abathur is very slow and very squishy, so I really don't understand how that works. I've been sitting in an empty lane to have my spawns just passively help push it, but if soaking means actually going out into the lane to phhysically pick up xp I don't see how abathur is good at that. I believe I get last hit xp but I feel like that has to be a different thing than ""soaking a lane"" since ""soaking"" is a term used quite a bit in this sub and seems to mean ""farming minion xp"" though I might be very wrong on that. Any advice on this subject would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys"

heroesofthestorm,"Outside of the box thinking, What else can be improved with Hots","Outside of the box thinking, what can be improved with Hots?

(By outside of the box, I mean other than the traditional tasks of hero design and game balance. And also given that we believe the team is now operating within a more limited capacity). 

Maps and map editor. If we had the ability to create new maps, it would widen the community of heroes. And potentially even being new content. 

New modes- Old brawls, maybe new types of ladders. At least the ability to play versus AI in ARAM. Would really love to play some type of Requires Random character selection match. Potentially be able to queue into matches as the role of your choice (heals; tank, bruiser etc) and be assigned a random hero within your collection to fit that role. 

At one point I was dreaming of HOTS 3.0 with UI improvements, but that’s probably too resource intensive to create. It wouldn’t be awful if Hots changed up their share/gem/money system to actually bring in more money, be that with skins or battle passes. 

Lastly, the community is so enthusiastic about HOTS- those of us that love it and have stuck around. Allowing HOTS to source development from the community might actually help: With custom maps or graphics; the tools already exist, it’s just a matter of access."

Is SL like this? Or I'm having bad luck?

being the only tank, when I tried to front or initiate, or generally didn't play at masters-like ability, I got focused down, the healer refused to heal that dps, and we eventually lost.

I'm curious what advice anyone has for when to draft Johanna vs Mei, if they're my two best tanks?

I think Mei is great on Alterac Pass/Sky Temple due to her zoning skills, and she has a large area to work with for her ults and long slide skill on E.

Johanna is who I take on Tomb of the Spider Queen/Infernal Shrines, and will draft her on Dragon Shire as well.

Regardless of team comp, who is better on a map like Battlefield of Eternity or Warhead Junction? 

I've played Muradin before and he seems to fit into most comps, but I have trouble with him when I'm a solo tank. If I ever need to jump out of a fight to regen health, means I'm leaving my team to die.

ETC is someone I play more of as well, but I find him to be very squishy. After playing some games with GREAT players of ETC, I clearly don't know how to use him properly."

heroesofthestorm,Meta Update: Plat+ patch 2.53.3 (March 2021 post bugfixes),"**Meta Update**  
Plat+ patch 2.53.3 (March 2021 post bugfixes)

**Tanks**  
Mei is the most influential tank. Icewall is her best ult with the cooldown buff pushing it to a drastically higher win rate over avalanche.  

Mal'ganis buffs are the real deal and he is the somewhat sleeper OP tank. Vulnerable to CC.  

Anub'arak is the longtime sleeper OP tank, locust build continues as the most popular build these days.  

The rest of the tanks are all having their lunch money stolen and are clustered between 45-50% win rates. Diablo/ETC are still good in the right hands. Muradin players should really start taking dwarf block unless vs Tracer/Tass/Tychus/Dva, it's great now that charges don't expire.

**Bruisers**  
Bruisers as a group are somewhat overpowered. Double bruiser is definitely a thing.

Sonya is not only dominating her role, but with her popularity and 57% winrate she is the most influential hero in the game. Slam build deals huge damage and doesn't require Sonya to go deep to deal mage levels of teamfight damage. That said, spin to win is still amazing if you are facing a Xul, Jaina, or Arthas.  

Gazlowe and Dva are still overpowered. Popular and sporting 54% win rates. Gazlowe is the stronger of the two at high level, especially if the game goes to late game, bombs for days.  

Xul is the sleeper OP bruiser maintaining a high win rate for multiple patches now, even on maps where he can't double soak.  

Hogger statistically seems balanced, just above 50%. That said if you play against one that knows the angles for the map, or if your team clusters up in a choke when he has full rage you will be destroyed.  


**Healers**  
The big news in healer land is Li Li is back in action. The most important thing is she now slows along with her blinds. Her serpent build is pretty good but her old builds work just fine too. The most important thing is how you position her for the soft cc she can provide. ""Hold down Q"" naysayers aside, you actually can target your heals if you pay attention. Usually best to be much closer to the frontline than other healers.  

Brightwing is the most popular hero in the game for a couple patches running now. She's quite good as polymorph and global value always help out. Poly is particularly good against Mal'ganis if he becomes meta.  

Rehgar has had a somewhat surprising drop in popularity but still excellent at his job, especially with an auto attack team where he can go bloodlust.   

Stukov, Whitemane, Kharazim, Auriel holding the 50%.  

Everyone else is under 50%.  

Alex continues to struggle.  


**Melee Assassins**  
Continue to suck as a group, you would be better off with pretty much any Ranged or even a Bruiser as your secondary ""Flex"" DPS. The occasional Zeratul, Kerrigan, Maiev, Samuro, Qhira one trick can still show up to wreck your day though.

**Support**  
Medivh pretty much should only be played in Masters.  

Vikings are overpowered but rare.  

Zarya mostly only good on Braxis and Volskaya.  

Abathur kind of feels like he makes matches a 50/50 tossup with a 45% chance to win before 20 and a 55% chance if the game goes past 20.  

**Ranged**  
Falstad is still good  post bug fix and worthy of a ban. W build still coming out strong but AA worth consideration.

Zul'jin is the king of single target late game DPS, recklessness OP.  

Cassia still OP.   

Run it down Azmo still winning games.  

Tychus good, but  a little overrated on the bans.  

Chromie nerfs worked, maybe too well, she's tied for worst mage win rates with KTZ. Stats aside I still feel she can do serious work with the right comp.  

Pretty much the all the huge number of other ranged assassins are in a good middleground spot, amazing job there by balance team over the past year.

As always, Genji and Hanzo should only be played in Diamond+ if you want to get the Dub.

heroesofthestorm,Petition to remove SL rank from QM MMR,"I don't know if its just my luck or if its actually a thing, but I have noticed a lot of sub 300 level accounts in the past few weeks with 54-58% winrates (a la Heroes Profiles), with silver ranking going against my friends(level 87 literally just started, and a master player) and me(low diamond). I look at the ranks at the end and it looks like it pairs us up with other players at about our same rank, but my new friend seems to be pitted against a lot of silvers who have these outrageously high winrates.  
Perhaps its  a team size thing and thats the result, I don't notice it a lot when I am playing alone, but it feels a lot like there is a heavy weight behind the SL rank for the purposes of match making.   
Has anyone else noticed this or is this just in my head?"
heroesofthestorm,Leaver penalty is way too harsh,"I just wanted to play one ranked game. My internet went out and now I have to play 6 games to get back to the rank I was before. The leaver penalty took away 4 games worth of ranked exp, and now it is forcing me to play 2 other game modes which I really hate (qm and aram). It is very unlikely that I will win all 6 games, maybe I will win half. So I have to play 12 games just to get back to net loss of zero? This is insane.  


I don't have a lot of time for gaming and hots is literally the only game I play. I really love this game I have been playing mobas since I was a kid but the leaver penalty is so incredibly harsh.

I never leave games but I get the leaver penalty every now and then because my internet messes up. It happened many times in 2020. So I am constantly being punished for something I didn't do. This has happened more times than I can remember, I didn't mind it at first but now it is incredibly frustrating.

On top of this there is rank decay. I try to play enough on my days off to get 1 week of rank protection but sometimes I forget to play because I have other things going on. So my rank is constantly being dropped down by rank decay and leaver penalties, WHEN I DONT EVEN HAVE THE TIME FOR GAMING TO BEGIN WITH.

Why hasn't this ever been changed? It's just insane. I have to play 12 games to get back to where I started and I didn't even leave the game.

Maybe I will change my mind but as I am getting older I value my time more and more. I really hope blizzard changes this leaver policy. For now I think I am done playing hots. I truly don't enjoy playing qm/aram. Those game modes are completely different from how mobas are meant to be played.

I suppose I would like to suggest to Blizzard to change the leaver penalty. If I could at least just play unranked to clear my leaver status it wouldn't be so bad. Thanks for reading."
heroesofthestorm,Hots down?,"Just says “you were disconnected from the blizzard service” when hots opens.

Edit 5pm CST. Was able to log in."
heroesofthestorm,It's possible?,"Is it difficult to create maps or Skins in Hots? 

Well I thought, Hots is created with the StarCraft II graphics engine, and in this the fans have created maps, mods and even missions for the same game, those who play SC will know that this is true, even some of these were approved by Blizzard itself. Is it possible that something like this happened for Hots? Maybe the same fans (who knows how to do that kind of thing) could maybe create maps or skins for the Heroes that already exist and if the designs are good or something like that, go to the base game?

&amp;#x200B;

It's just an idea"
heroesofthestorm,[Rant]Disconnect just at the end of the game,"My internet is kinda trash by itself, but I kind of got used to lagging sometimes, but recently I had several matches where my net and game was all fine or we even won, but literally at the very end it disconnects so it labels the match as ""lost"" and I get zero xp and level and even puts me in leavers status.

Anyone else experiencing this? Nothing really makes me angry about the game except when this happens, basically a wasted 20-30 minutes"
heroesofthestorm,I believe Samuro should get a balance pass.,"I feel that for some time now, ever since the last round of changes, the hero has been in a weird spot. I've given it some thought and I've come up with some points I'd like to see addressed.

- Wind Storm build ([T3211323,Samuro]) currently does too much for how easy it is to use, and it really can't be nerfed without it either being meaningless (13/16/20 nerf), making it garbage (1/7/10 nerf) or disproportionately affecting Illusion Master builds (base stats/kit nerfs). I think they should look to make Bladestorm a bit more complex in its usage instead


- Crushing Blows was mathematically killed when it got nerfed -It now takes 7 hits to surpass Burning Blade and 9 hits to surpass Phantom Pain in damage, and it comes with none of the side benefits (wave clear and D CDR, respectively)- the stacking cap should be raised to ~5 to actually make it good. 
 - It's also worth to mention that currently Phantom Pain and Crushing Blows have a bit of an overlap in the situations they work in, which leads to a direct damage math contest that always has a definitive winner. I think it's worth considering the idea of moving a bit more of Phantom Pain's power to its CDR component to help combat this.


- Illusion Master feels overall weak currently, and runs into a lot of issues where many Heroes are able to shut down its offensive with relative ease. It also suffers from having too much of its power pie in safety and defensive tools, and too little in actual offense - This creates a lot of ""feels bad"" moments when playing the hero, while also removing the joy from doing escapes with Samuro, because it's no longer something exceptional that feels rewarding, rather it's just what you're regularly supposed to do, and that both sucks, and makes it joyless.

 - I've been toying with the idea of giving Samuro some added attack speed for a few seconds after swapping with a clone, I think it has merit, so I'll put it out here.


- Samuro's level 20 tier is pretty mediocre and i think it could use some changes to make it more interesting. I never find myself looking forward or caring about that tier at all, and i think it's a damn shame when put into the context of so many other heroes get absolutely awesome talents at level 20 that they are looking forward to for the entire game.

Thanks for reading, have a nice one, and happy women's day to all the ladies of the Nexus."

heroesofthestorm,"[Hero Concept] Reinhardt, Hero of Eichenwalde (Tank)","*A member of the German Crusaders during the Omnic Crisis, Reinhardt Wilhelm joined Overwatch after the Battle of Eichenwalde in the stead of his mentor, Balderich von Adler, after Balderich's death. Reinhardt styles himself as a champion of a bygone age, who lives by the knightly codes of valor, justice, and courage. Now in the Nexus, Reinhardt brings his knightly ways to combat the wicked and protect the innocent, as well as satisfy his love for battle.*

---

#General Concept
&gt;Reinhardt is a powerful melee tank who can intercept projectiles aimed at his allies, even ones from autoattacks. Despite that he's a big target and lacks sustain, Reinhardt can take a tremendous amount of punishment and dish it back with his potent but slow attacks.

**Pros**

- Strong against projectile attacks
- Exceptional durability
- Very powerful ultimate abilities
- Strong waveclear
- Powerful initiation
- Excellent frontliner

**Cons**

- No self-sustain
- Predictable
- Long, punishable cooldowns
- Easily outmaneuvered
- Susceptible against non-projectile attacks
- Vulnerable if isolated

---

#Abilities
*(expect changes)*

**Trait - Rocket Hammer**  
&gt;Reinhardt's basic attacks cleave in a wide arc, dealing considerable damage and briefly slowing enemies hit, but he attacks slowly.

**Q - Fire Strike**  
&gt;Fire a skillshot that damages all enemies in a line. The first target struck by Fire Strike takes significant bonus damage.

**W - Crusader Barrier**  
&gt;Reinhardt activates his barrier and faces it in the target direction for a short time, intercepting all incoming enemy projectiles and significantly reducing all damage he takes through the barrier. Reinhardt cannot attack or use abilities while using Crusader Barrier, but can cancel it early if needed.

**E - CHAAAARGE!**  
&gt;After a short wind-up, Reinhardt becomes Unstoppable and dashes in a straight line in the target direction, catching the first enemy Hero he comes in contact with and knocking aside anything else. If he collides with a wall, any enemy Hero he has caught with his dash takes heavy damage and is briefly stunned. Reinhardt can adjust his trajectory during the dash at a highly reduced capacity.

**R1 - Earthshatter**  
&gt;After a 0.75 second wind-up, Reinhardt damages and stuns all enemies in a large cone in front of him.

**R2 - Hammerspin**  
&gt;Reinhardt starts spinning his hammer around him over 4 seconds, continuously damaging nearby enemies. When enemies are first hit by Hammerspin, they are briefly knocked airborne. Reinhardt can move and is Unstoppable for the duration of Hammerspin, but cannot attack or use other abilities.

---

#Talents  
*(need more ideas; placeholder names)*

**Blazing Strike**  
Fire Strike leaves behind a trail of flames that deal continuous damage to enemies standing in it.

**Overwhelming Fire**  
Fire Strike now deals bonus damage to the first two enemies it hits instead of just the first one.

**Wide Flame**  
Increases the width of Fire Strike.

**I Am Your Shield!**  
Upon activating Crusader Barrier, nearby allied Heroes receive bonus armor for a short time.

**Unbreakable**  
The first instance of damage that hits Crusader Barrier is negated.

**Ultimate Crushing Machine!**  
Reinhardt's Rocket Hammer deals X% increased damage to Minions and Mercenaries.

**100% German Power!**  
Rocket Hammer deals X% increased damage if it hits more than one Hero.

**Inexorable Charge**  
Reinhardt receives bonus armor while using CHAAAARGE!, and for X seconds afterward.

**And Stay Down!**  
CHAAAARGE! deals X% of a caught enemy Hero's maximum health if it collides with terrain.

**Bring Me Another!** (level 16/20)  
CHAAAAARGE can now catch up to 2 enemy Heroes at once.

**Blitzkrieg**  
When Reinhardt activates CHAAAARGE!, nearby allied Heroes receive bonus movement speed temporarily.

**Earthbreaker**  
After 2.5 seconds, Earthshatter occurs again in the same area.

**Rapid Spin**  
Increase the duration of Hammerspin by 1 second, and Reinhardt gains up to 40% bonus movement speed over the duration of Hammerspin, starting at 10% and increasing over time.

---

**Hero Synergy**  
&gt;Reinhardt works very well with either Wombo Combo teams or with diving compositions; with the former, his Earthshatter can easily set up his team, while with the latter he can lead the charge by pinning an enemy. He also works well protecting valuable teammates from incoming ranged attacks with his shield, so he can do quite well alongside allies like Sgt. Hammer. He'll need a good medic, though, and allies like Ana or Rehgar can be very helpful. Reinhardt's single-target damage can be lacking, so allies who can compensate for that will help a great deal; examples include Valla, Zul'jin, and Raynor.

**Hero Counters**  
&gt;Reinhardt's biggest weakness is his predictability and long cooldowns, so his downtime can be easily exploited and his charges can be easily punished, especially if his teammates don't follow up his initiation. Highly mobile enemies like Tracer, Illidan, or Valla, as well as heroes with dodging abilities like Maiev, can easily avoid his charges and even his Earthshatter. Heroes with non-projectile abilities like Jaina (Blizzard) or Kael'thas (Flamestrike) can get past his Crusader Barrier and still hit his teammates, while mobile heroes can quickly run past him while he's trying to shield in a particular direction and hit him in the back. Reinhardt's lack of self-sustain also means he can be bullied out of a solo lane by opponents like Sonya, Artanis, Rexxar, Malthael, or Zul'jin. Reinhardt's crowd controls are also totally ineffective against Deathwing, making Reinhardt a poor choice against him.

toggle off: healing beam heals the target for 43 health per second, while channeling morales regenerates 4% of her maximum health and 3 energy per second.

toggle on: healing beam heals the target for 172 health per second and grants 15 armor, but costs 6 energy per second.

new W: optic flare, reveals and reduces the enemy line of sight by 50% while they stay inside the area. lasts 3 seconds, 15s cooldown

Yet simultaneously it is also true that ppl hate seeing uther in draft. I cannot confirm for gm games, but have master friends who have had similar experiences in masters. Whenever you show uther you always get


1 uther is bad solo healer

3 uther as a bruiser? Makes no sense he’s a healer
4 uther maintank only works in “insert higher rank”

And when you actually take insight over IF?"
heroesofthestorm,How to report a matchmaking bug?,"I have played 10 ranked games today (B2). Every time I get to B1, the system matches me with players who don't know how soak, or that they should do camps, or that aram is a different game mode, or that ranked is not the right place or trying heroes they have never played before. I lost 8 of these 10 games and none of them was even close to a win. It was obvious that we would lose after 4 lvls.

Since I experienced this situation several times, I think it is some kind of intended behavior.  How can I report this bug?"
heroesofthestorm,Malf sleep talent could use a little functionality adjustment.,"Maybe malf deserves some time in the upper echelons of the tier list but I feel like his new sleep talent is pretty disgusting. I don’t mind the sleep itself, but i think the root should have to last for it’s whole duration or at least a large portion of it. The way the talent works currently, if you use a cleanse you just get slept immediately, meaning only real unstoppables can save you there. 
Popping root removal on Zuljin only to be slept immediately and inevitably wombo’d feels really bad lol."

heroesofthestorm,My take on an Illidan Rework,"#Why Illidan Needs a Rework:

Sometimes heroes need reworks because their mechanics are clunky or bad, but I don’t think that is the case with Illidan. I and many others feel like he is super fun to play, he just has many bad matchups that he becomes pretty useless against. I think that part of the reason is that not only is he vulnerable to hard cc (Stun, root, silence) as he should be, but he is also extremely vulnerable to soft cc (Blind, Slow, heal reduction). Being able to consistently basic attack to refresh his cooldowns is really important to Illidan. Since he is a hero with no cc other than an ult, a small slow on 20, and bodyblocks, he really relies on his abilities to stay in attack range of enemies. If he can’t use abilities, he can’t attack, and if he can’t attack, he can’t use abilities. Even enemy movement speed increases make it difficult to trigger trait, making it hard to do much of anything versus the great number of heroes that can simply run away. Now, before you tell me to git good and learn to A-move hear me out. I’m not saying that Illidan should be able to do everything well and not have weaknesses, or even that the above should not happen to Illidan, I’m just pointing out that these soft forms of CC really disproportionately effect Illidan more then any other hero and he could use some tweaks to help compensate against it. Over the years CC has become more and more prevalent, with the last hero without some form of cc on a basic ability being Mephisto, and before that Hanzo (both of which have hard cc ults). 

#Rework Goals:

* At the foremost is to keep the current feeling of Illidan. He is my personal favorite and most played hero. I enjoy the high risk high reward playstyle. I think that his skill floor should remain high and his abilities create a really unique and fun hero. I don’t want my rework to change his core playstyle at all.

* I don’t think Illidan needs buffs, Currently, when he’s good he's really good, but most of the time he just isn’t good. Illidan lives on a knife's edge, which is what makes him so hard to adjust. If he just gets a numbers increase, he will easily become OP and dominate matches. One of my main goals has been to improve him without strictly buffing him. I’ve done this mostly by giving him utility and counterplay.

* Increase his team presence. Part of the Illidumb problem is that he relies on teammates and teammates don’t really get any benefits from him. He’s got damage right now, and that’s just about it. I tried to add a debuff build similar to Leoric’s. This way, even if you have a bad Illidan, hopefully he can help you out just a little bit.

* Just make him cooler. For years we’ve had heroes released with dynamic and interesting abilities that push the game in new directions. Illidan is still rocking Bolt of the Storm and Nexus Blades. 

* Throw in some more lore. Having a faux Mana Burn and Chaos Damage return I think would be a good nod to Warcraft 3. I’ve also made some references to events that have happened more recently in WoW.

#Baseline Changes:

**Sweeping Strike**

Adjusted Functionality: Dash towards target point, dealing 119 (+4% per level) damage to enemies along the way. Hitting an enemy grants Illidan Chaos Damage, increasing his Basic Attack damage by 35% for 3 seconds. *Chaos Damage is a new keyword that will be used in his talents. Other then that this is a strictly cosmetic change to the already present damage bonus save for the fact that a second cast refreshes the duration instead of starting a new one. This is only relevant for a few talents*

**Dive**

Additional Functionality: Can now be used to dive to allied Heroes. *Making this baseline is way overdue*


#Talents:

**Level 1: Damage Tier.** *Each of these talents introduce a different dynamic playstyle that should make every game different based on what you're facing or prefer.*

1. **Unending Hatred** *PvE and single target*  
New functionality: **Quest:** Every second Chaos Damage has been active for longer than 3 seconds, gain 0.1 Basic Attack Damage. Hero Takedowns grant 1 Basic Attack Damage. *If Illidan is left free on lanes or camps, he can become a monster late game.*

2. **Battered Assault** *PvP*  
If Sweeping Strike hits 2 Heroes, Chaos Damage’s bonus is increased from 35% to 100%. This effect lasts as long as you maintain Chaos Damage. *Down from 125%. This is to offset the fact that it can now last indefinitely. Increased risk, Increased payoff.*

3. **Mana Burn** *PvE, AoE, and Anti-spells*  
Chaos Damage burns nearby enemies for 22 (+4% per level) damage a second for 4 seconds. Enemy heroes hit by this get their spell power reduced by 3 for 3 seconds, stacking up to 10 times. *Immolation, but now has a niche that will make it situationally better since it was the weakest on the tier*

**Level 4: Sustain Tier.** *I thought that Illidan needed some buffs to survivability while not actually increasing his survivability.*

1. **Reflexive Block**  
Additional Functionality: Increases the range of Dive by 20% *Now that Friend or Foe is baseline I wanted to put the range increase somewhere and Reflexive Block needed the buff. This will also help him escape danger easier.*

2. **Thirsting Blade**  
Additional Functionality: Illidian’s Auto-attacks now ignore armor while Chaos Damage is active. *Giving Illi anti-armor gives him a small niche that could help his pick rate. Will also guarantee that he gets the lifeleech he deserves. Warcraft 3 mechanics friendly. ***Cenerius sweats nervously***.*

3. **Hunter's Onslaught**  
Additional functionality: Each enemy hero hit by Sweeping Strike grants 10% movement speed for 2 seconds, up to 30%. *An extremely brief movement speed increase is good for getting that perfect bodyblock or little bit of head start needed to escape, while it fades before you can truly do anything insane.*

**Level 7: Utility Tier.**  *Each of these talents introduce a dynamic playstyle based on what you might need. The talents are named after the roles Illidan has played in his life.*

1. **Warrior**  
Sweeping Strike can go over walls and terrain. **Reward:** After hitting 15 Heroes with Sweeping Strike, gain a second charge.

2. **Prisoner**  
Illidan enters Timestop for up to 1.5 seconds. Upon exiting, gain Chaos Damage. This cooldown benefits from Betrayer’s Thirst. 40 second cooldown. *A very short timestop can help dodge big effects, but keeps DoTs and current cooldowns unlike stasis. Picking this defensive talent means you lose the damage potentials that you could have gotten from the other talents, but getting an ability like this so early is strong.*

3. **Betrayer**  
Whenever an enemy hero dies, gain 10% increased healing from all sources for 10 seconds. When an ally hero dies, gain 10% attack speed for 10 seconds. Each separately stacking up to 5 times. *The real betrayal is when your ally tries to 1v5 with this talent after the rest of you have died.*

4. **Jailor**  
Hitting enemy heroes with basic abilities slows them by 5% for 3 seconds, stacking up to 4 times.

**Level 10: Ultimate Tier**

1. **Metamorphosis**  
Unchanged

2. **The Hunt**  
Unchanged

**Level 13: Survivability Tier**

1. **I’m Blind not Deaf**  
While Evasion is active, Illidan is immune to blind effects and his movement speed can't be reduced. Increases Evasion’s cooldown by 1.

2. **Vengeful Immolation**  
Evasion explodes upon ending, dealing 40% of evaded damage back in an area. Illidan heals for 30% of damage dealt by the explosion.

3. **Reckless Hatred**  
Illidan gains 30 armor. For each second Chaos Damage is active, decrease this amount by 5, up to 6 times. *Illidan frequently struggles with dying on impact with the enemy team. This will help him survive past the initial engage, while also giving opponents counterplay.*

**Level 16: Damage Tier** *I really like every talent on this tier. Each one has a place. Blades of Azzinoth might be the best one, but the others are still fun and useful.*

1. **Marked for Death**  
Unchanged

2. **Fiery Brand**  
Unchanged

3. **Blades of Azzinoth**  
Unchanged

**Level 20: Storm Tier**

1. **Demonic Form**  
Unchanged *Why mess with perfection?*

2. **Nowhere to Hide**  
Additional functionality: Illidan’s Auto-attacks now reveal enemy heroes for 5 seconds. *Most “chaser” heroes have some sort of reveal, and I thought it made the most sense to be here.*

3. **I am my Scars**  
Basic attacks reduce the current death timer of allied heroes by 1. Evasion gives 30 spell armor. *See edit section for changes and reasoning*

4. **At any Cost**  
Illidan’s attacks now cleave, triggering Betrayer’s Thirst on each target hit.

#All feedback and suggestions are welcome! Especially from my Illidan hero /u/Felewin! What build would you go?  



EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses. Here's some changes I'd make based on your suggestions!  

**Sweeping Strike**  
Each enemy hero hit by this ability extends the duration of Chaos Damage by 0.5 seconds. *This should help keep Chaos damage up to give you the time you need for 1 more AA so that it is easier to combo into a second cast, while also not giving duration without risk or in lane.*

**Prisoner**  
Illidan enters Timestop for 1.5 seconds. *Now forced to be the full duration of 1.5*

**I am my Scars**  
Basic attacks reduce the current death timer of allied heroes by 0.3, Tripled versus enemy heroes. While no heroes are dead Evasion gives 30 spell armor. *You all really focused on this talent and for good reason, it's meant to be very strong and game defining. When is comes to being the only allied hero alive Illidan is currently really weak as he has zero poke. When you have teamates down and the enemy is pushing, Illidan is sometimes forced to just watch and hope the enemy badly mispositions. I think that this talent could help compensate that by giving him a way to defend a push while maintaining his strengths and weaknesses. The ability has to be strong as picking it sacrifices the damage, utility, and survivability potentials from the other talents. In addition, it is a lose-less feature that you only get value from if you are currently losing the game. But there were some good points in that it encourages Illidan to not participate in fights as he can get incredible value by being elsewhere. So I nerfed it so that the real value comes from facing the enemy heroes, while you can still get reduction from the lanes and jungle.*"
heroesofthestorm,Has anybody else had that unmount/throw bug with garrosh before?,"Im curious to know if it's just me, but sometimes when im mounted with garrosh and try to throw an opponent I get dismounted and the throw doesnt occur.  
Im 100% sure im not being dismounted by anything else than my own spell, Garrosh E.   
The spell does not go on cooldown tho.

It's weird it's like the spell doesnt quite goes off and it just dismount me.  
What's even weirder is that you can buffer auto-attacks while mounted, and that doesn't dismount you, so there's no reasons to be dismounted when buffering Garry's throw (if it's even possible to do so lol).  
It's been like that since they fixed his throw going on CD when used on moving heroes.  


Anyway, it's kinda frustrating to be honest, happens to me once or twice per game.  
I'll try to post a video later on :)"
heroesofthestorm,Rehgar's [Electric Charge] Talent tooltip is misleading.,"It's such a simple talent that many players get wrong:

&gt;Increases the radius of Lightning Shield by 25%.Heal for 30% of the damage it deals to enemy Heroes.

What everybody gets wrong. And it's a truth you can check even in try mode:**REHGAR** is the one who is healed, no matter the target.You put it on minion -&gt; Rehgar get healedYou put it on a tank -&gt; only Rehgar get healedNobody else is affected by bonus healing other than Rehgar.

It's a common misconception i find in QM's and even rank games in diamond. I even got flamed for not making use of Rehgar's Storm Shield healing as a bruiser... ye ...in diamond game.People often get confused by taciturn description. It may even lead to picking Electric Charge only because it's the only healing ability in the tier.

Simple fix to the tooltip should fix the problem:

&gt;Increases the radius of Lightning Shield by 25%.**Rehgar is healed** for 30% of the damage it deals to enemy Heroes.

Or we could adjust functionality so most of those mislead players are actually right and the spell heals the target instead of rehgar.

Or we could just delete healing aspect of the talent and add something else to the spell. Like +1 sec duration or smt.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly speaking im all about adjusting the tooltip/description so people don't get confused.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  
Here another reason to why it is confusing.  


Looking at hots wiki. \[Electric Charge\] is a talent that infuses Rehgar's W with lifesteal.  
Sentence like ,,heals for x% of dmg dealt"" is common for abilities with lifesteal property.  
However, Rehgar's W is the only spell that can be casted upon friendly target with lifesteal property in the game. Thus why poor tooltip leads to a lot of confusion.

Ragnaros has a similar talent that gives shield instead of health based on dealth damage.  
LvL 13 talent:

&gt; When Blast Wave damages an enemy Hero, **you gain** a Shield equal to 100% of the damage dealt for 3 seconds.   


As you can clearly see. There is much less confusion here even though talents work almost the same."

&amp;#x200B;

Vengeful Roots (Malfurion, 1E)

→ Entangling Roots spawns a Treant that does 58 damage per second and lasts 10 seconds (quest).

→ Passive:  Increase the Root duration of Entangling Roots by 25%. (Tenacious Roots)

&amp;#x200B;

Blade of Justice (Tyrael, 13Q)

→  Upon teleporting using El'druin's Might, El'druin swaps places with Tyrael, and El'druin's Might can be reactivated to teleport an additional time.

heroesofthestorm,Just faced a weird opening move.,"It was QP, but I'm pretty certain they were a group.  
Their comp: Sylvanas, Morales, Deathwing, Varian and Abathur.   
The map: Warhead Junction (but, as I said, QP)   
   

The game begins, we all move on midlane, ready for the usual skirmish that happens right at the start.. 
Nothing.  
The first minion wave arrives, we start kiling them. Still no enemy in sight.  
Then suddenly we see them on our minimap, they went bot, sneaked around and start attacking our fort directly (using Sylvanas's trait while Varian and then Deathwing damaged the fort).  

We rushed toward them, barely managing to prevent them from destroying the fort by killing them, but they were lvl 1, so they were back right away.  
Then, they tried doing the same (sneaking around, hitting a fort with Sylvanas's trait) on top.   
We killed them and barely saved our fort.    
Then they did the same again on bot, this time destroying the fort.  
Varian went twinblades.     


We eventually did manage to win, but that's the first time I ever saw this opening move."
heroesofthestorm,So this is how the game is now??,"Took about 4 months away from HOTS and played some over the weekend.

The first two matches were two teammates from their previous game getting into a pissing match so they trolled each other which affected us who were caught in their crossfire.  Why do we gotta suffer because these two want to go at it???  Then the third game a completely different troll who got into it with another teammate and started to call him NI\*\*\*R at least three times during the game.  Really??  How does Blizzard keep this garbage in the game??

heroesofthestorm,Missing Enemy UI Suggestion,Sometimes I find it difficult to tell who's showing on the mini-map when there are multiple characters crowded in the same place.  I think it would be a good idea to have a visual indicator on the hero portraits at the top of the screen that indicates whether or not they are visible.  Perhaps a highlighted border if they are visible or a question mark if they are missing.  This would really help when the hero icons are stacked on top of each other on the mini-map.

heroesofthestorm,The problems with smurfing in lower leagues (aka where do your points go),"Hey, I just stopped playing ranked (and probably the whole game altogether) because I had an epiphany, 'caused by playing Quickmatch again after the new patch when I tried out rework Li Li (have been playing mostly ranked and ARAM the last weeks).

I played about 15 games in QM mostly duo queueing with a Sonya which lead to somewhat ballanced matchups (at least a healer and bruiser on both sides). The match quality in those QM had been much better than in ranked. People were less stressed and for some reason I had less games of that usual kind ""being ahead for 15 minutes, then losing 2 team fights because that Valla thinks she can now that you have been ahead for such a long time 1v3 some of their guys, leading to a defeat"".

Then I went back to ranked and found out that almost every match I had a smurf on opposing team (B-stepping us poor noobs into oblivion) or on my own team with some sort of Master League savior complex ""let me tell you how to draft and I will carry you out of Gold League"". One game I had a 85% win rate smurf on my team who still had Tracer hovered in the lobby and refused to draft accordingly (two ranged damage dealers had already been taken). Actually that person didn't respond at all and therefore I, who was draft leader, banned Tracer which resulted into the lobby to dispand and let that poor smurf get some point panalty on those precious ranked points.

Now I come to the core of my analysis mentioned in the title: smurfs steal points of people in their appropriate leagues.

It's basic math that if there is at least one smurf among 10 players (and it is not you). The chances that they end with their increased skills up on the opposing team and not yours is slightly higher than being on your own team. They have unusual high win rates (depending on skill between 55 and 85% haven't seen higher) and will drag points out of you in the long run, as long as you play a decent number of matches. Since smurfs have several accounts they can just go to lower ranks with their smurf, ""steal"" some points and leave that league forver, just to return to their main, while the ""stolen"" points are offline and can't be reclaimed, therefore lost forever unless the smurf decides to return with a much lower win rate to redistribute the rank points they have taken from the league.

Since I found out that about 70-80% of my matches have a smurf on one or both sides this means that you need a lot more skill to reach that 50%&gt; win rate yourself to climb out of your league than it should if there were no smurfs involved and match making would just match you up with players of your own league and there are no ""anti-smurfs"" (people with a converse win rate of 15-45% that are ranked way too high and you could safely ""farm"" for points, because it is not possible to reach any league above Silver, unless it's good player starting to deliberatly throw a high number of their games).

TL;DR - Smurfs farm points from lower leagues and leave, therefore people from their respective leagues have to struggle and have much stronger performances to climb out of league (or even hold their ranks) as they should."

heroesofthestorm,Can we have more supports? 4 hardly qualifies as a class.,"Just saying. Not sure what another support could do? Maybe a buff or debuff focused hero. Sombra or Rory Swann for example. Actually Rory would be a great idea. It’s been too long since we had a Starcraft hero and too long since we had a support, and that is exactly what Rory’s job is. He is a support!

He could have marauder style auto attacks that deal okay damage with abilities that buff his team mates. Something like this:

Q: Augment Weapons: Activate to increase a target ally’s Physical Attack damage by 15% for 6 seconds.

W: Augment Armor: Activate to increase a target ally’s armor by 20 for 6 seconds.

heroesofthestorm,What is it about this game that makes it irresistible to trolls?,"Just played against somebody named ""all reported"" level 53 as soon they hit storm league nothing but losses, was valla on towers with around 120k siege dmg, and 5k hero dmg. first 10 min of the game she didnt have any dmg at all. like it couldnt be any less subtle

&amp;#x200B;

like why? so many questions regarding the motivation to do this. why waste your time and others like that? like why is this playerbase bombarded with so many  trolls? its not even a popular game

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest. Ive been gaming since the 80s, and I never played a game with such a spiteful manic playerbase in game. If it's not a troll its somebody going off the handle and throwing at the drop of a hat. Like I just dont get why this game and emotional instability and spitefulness go hand in hand. Its fucking weird. Spitefulness towards your own team is rampant in this game to a level I have never seen matched before in any other game.

Would be a good game if it wasn't for these weird players. Like they are all the same carbon copies of each other too, they all act the same. its weird as well mang. I know somebody is going to tell me all mobas are toxic or something, but heroes is diff than most mobas to begin with , way more casual, like i just dont see what warrants all this strange negative behavior constantly in this game. Like I get added all the time by other players just because I'm sane and I play the game, like everybody who plays is desperately seeking a group thats rational. That's the high mark for this game.

It's not just negative behavior but its negative behavior for seemingly no reason at all. I've seen the weirdest brands of trolling ever in this game. A game we were stomping and our mage just suddenly says after nobody saying anything all game ""you guys dont deserve to win"" and sits in hearth while we are up. Like weird shit like that. I've never experienced such bizarre trolling in any game but heroes. The only word I can use to describe it is bizarre. I've had people get mad we WON but we didn't win the way they wanted to (like choosing to do boss at a weird time instead of just going straight to core) the behavior just baffles me. Am I just old and this is how the new generation acts? The game was NOTHING like this during preseason and scoreboard didnt count individual kills, I made it to top ranks and got the epic elemental wolf mount, game seemed solid. Somewhere around chogall something happened and weirder and weirder behavior started seeping in the game, and now, the normal games without a troll or strangely  bizarre spiteful hateful antagonistic person are the anomalies. Like if I play against somebody and I notice their play is exceptionally bizarre, like that valla mention, I know if I queue next game they'll be on my team since the playerbase is so low, and mmr just wants to play tit for tat. So what I do is set up a whisper to them, don't say anything, I just set up the whisper so it shows their status on my chat box if they are in a new game or logged off. I NEVER had to do this with any other game except heroes, because if theres a potato doing weird shit like that, its just a waste of everybodys time, unless you are into that weird ""getting over it"" brand of difficulty where you will most likely not succeed but find it fun to try anyway "
heroesofthestorm,Falstad thoughts,"As a long-time fan of the flying-dwarf-that's-not-Muradin-jumping, I was really encouraged to see some significant changes to Falstad in the last patch. While I was a little perturbed to see Wingman disappear, I was mostly geeked to finally see some attention paid to Lightning Rod, since it had easily been the least useful of his basic abilities for years. Given its sizable mana cost and cooldown, it didn't function that well as a ""filler"" ability, either, since that mana served a much better purpose being saved for as many tosses of the hammer (and Barrel Rolls) as possible. But when they finally made W build viable and modified the AA build, I didn't expect both of those to come at the cost of Q build. We basically went from two builds (Q and AA)... to two builds (W and AA) because the Hammer build is just not viable with the new changes, since it requires far more effort for far less return than the other two.

Dishonorable Discharge is amazing, even with the bug fixed. In most games you'll probably never finish the quest, which is a little disappointing, but the extra damage and the reduced CD(!) make it all worth it. It's, appropriately, the foundation for the entire build. It's also nice that the ability itself replaces Wingman to some degree. Similarly, Frequent Flyer is the absolute foundation for the AA build, since it can also be used to reactivate Tailwind, which means that Falstad can still be a viable solo laner. But Gathering Storm and, thus, the Q build is basically ruined at the moment. The damage ""bonus"" is so meager that it will be easily outstripped by the other two talents, every game, without fail. This on top of the almost 33% reduction in the ability's damage in the first place makes it pointless.

Minions don't dodge attacks and no one can dodge Lightning Rod while they're in range, but the Hammer can be avoided, which makes it more difficult to generate stacks and, for that matter, get a mana return on it (which is almost as pathetic a return as the damage ""bonus"".) Again, it's more work for less return than the other two builds. You can see this at later tiers, too. Secret Weapon is still viable for the AA build, since it almost doubles his attack damage before the hammer returns, but BOOMerang simply isn't worthwhile, since the hammer now does so little damage in the first place and the explosion isn't much better. There's more of an argument for Crippling Hammer, except that if you've taken the Q build and are still (somehow) winning, it becomes a ""win more"" talent. And, in the end, it can't really hold a candle to Aerie Gusts or Afterburner.

So, again, it's really cool to see one of the original heroes get some needed upgrades, but it's also really unfortunate to see a build that some have been playing for most of the game's existence (since right around the time Thunderstorm and Aerial Blitzkrieg were removed) essentially get phased out. The large print giveth and the small print taketh away, as it were."

heroesofthestorm,State of Storm League,"Today I solo queued 3000 seconds multiple times into terrible games. I know the quality of the games are coincidental, but the queue time for a diamond player shouldn't be this extreme. Hopefully they can redefine the SL matchmaker to compensate for the fewer and fewer players, because at this point there's really no point in player SL for me with queue times this long, on a weekend. For some reason queuing with 3 people is way faster. Why are solo queuers punished so hard?"
heroesofthestorm,"If you want Q Mephisto to be good, undo this recent change","Hello everyone!

As you guys already know, Mephisto has recently been adjusted to have more power in his Q talents. As much as I like his changes, there's one change I'm really not happy about: The lvl 1 Quest talent.

In the following I'd like to comment on why I think this recent change is actually a nerf compared to   
it's previous variation.

I have been a fan of Q build Mephisto since a pretty long time and I can safely say that I consider myself as a good Mephisto player.

So why is the adjusted functionality of the lvl 1 Quest actually a nerf?  
At first glance it actually doesn't seem to be a nerf, you have 2 charges instead of one, but with the downside that it doesn't give you cdr anymore (3 seconds cd reduction -&gt; 2nd charge). What it basically does is that you can use your Q twice in a short period of time, which is good on paper, but let me give you an example:

**You hit no heroes with your Q's:**

* I gave both variants *""seconds""*, the *""2nd charge""* one can use his Q if he has 8 seconds, the *""3sec cdr""* one when he has 5 seconds.
* Both *""2nd charge""* and *""3sec cdr"" Mephisto* uses their Q ability at the same time, but only if the ""*3sec cdr""* one can use his Q since it has a lower cd.
* the **-&gt;** indicates a Q was casted
* I ignored the cast time and flight speed just to simplify the problem, while also maintaining a realistic result

""***2nd charge"":*** *(it has 16 points because it has 2 charges (2\*8)*  
\[16sec  **-&gt;**   8sec\]  **+5sec**  \[13sec  **-&gt;** 5sec\]  +**5sec**  \[10sec  **-&gt;**  2sec\]  **+5sec**  \[7sec  **-&gt;** \-1sec\]

***""3sec cdr"":***  
\[  5sec  **-&gt;**   0sec\]  **+5sec**  \[  5sec  **-&gt;** 0sec\]  **+5sec**  \[  5sec  **-&gt;**  0sec\]  **+5sec**  \[5sec  **-&gt;**  0sec\]

So after 4 Q the second charge loses in cdr and therefore damage!

I also did the math if the Q hits only one or 2 heroes and turns out it doesn't matter, the result is still the same.

So after you have used Q 4 times (in a teamfight scenario where both Q charges doesn't recharge), you basically lose 3 seconds of cdr for every additional Q in comparison to the old Quest talent .

Here are 2 short clips from the same game to exemplify my point:  
[Fight 1](https://imgur.com/a/tgMr769)  
[Fight 2](https://imgur.com/a/Qi48M2r)

As you can see, I was able to cast Q multiple times, 11 times to be exact in both teamfights. If I had the second charge variation, I would've lost about 22 seconds worth of cooldown reduction for the Q ability: (11-4)\*3+1=22. I would've been able to only cast  \~7 Q \[11-(22/5)\].

So basically the longer you are in a team fight, the worse the cooldown of Q becomes, until one point where the cd of Q is back to the original 8 seconds, making it seem like that you never took a lvl 1 talent.

TL;DR: Blizzard Devs, if you intended to buff the Q build for Mephisto, revert his lvl 1 Quest change.

Ah btw sorry for the bad english, it isn't my mother tongue :D"

heroesofthestorm,Zul’jin seems pretty underrated,"When an individual solos a lane as zul’jin, it puts the enemy team in an ugly lose-lose situation. If they don’t engage you, they lose a buttload of soak and your team gets the lead. If they do engage you, you get to stack on them, which will give you a massive lead later. Also, very few people can actually win a trade with Zul’jin. 

3 outcomes:

1. The enemy team lets you stack 1v1 and they are screwed

2. The enemy team leaves you alone and then they are screwed

3. They send multiple people after you, and you stack very slowly while your team dominates the rest of the map. 

As long as your team is competent, you can create a massive lead that not very many carries can do. Just watch your health and you can stomp."
heroesofthestorm,We need quicker smurfs promotions to appropriate league.,"Blizzard should stop treating rank as bragging rights and elevate people to proper ranks quicker. How are we supposed to get even matches when being matched with 94lvl accounts that dominate whole match due to extreme game's knowledge and experience several times in a row. How can he stay in same league for so long? Ranks should be adjusted not just by win/lose but also by performance during match compared to average in that league. Or at least give rapid advancement trough streaks. I dont give a damn how quickly someone gets to diamong/master league, i dont want them to stay in my casual league and meet them over and over again, where team cant do anything against this disparity in expertise, seeing completly different level of play and knowing no counter to it (or having none due to non-master counter picks and knowledge of weaknesses of particular builds and playstyles. You dont throw proffesional football players who have trainings daily against casuals playing friendly amateur matches once in a while. Simply becouse its not fun. I dont know what produces smurfs - is it low self esteem or bans, but they should not stay in low ranks for so long and ruin others' experience. This game is very sensitive to this type of stuff. One wrongly matched player and its just horrible steamroll. Treat players like a meatshields, do nothing about smurfs and hots wont live much longer.

I dont mind people ""nolifing"" games like that, but let them play with similar people for even matches. I want to be matched with people who play as much as i do.

So either rapid rank adjustments, especially during first dozens of matches or longer entry point to ranked pool. Or perhaps both."

So i have to stay safe from poke.. yet, when its time to engage i need to get close to do my thing. So either i get poked down or i find it really hard to engage.

Peeling is alright though.

heroesofthestorm,This is an example of why the game we once loved is dying.,"Below you will find my initial (humorous) review of the new LiLi changes. And the response I received from Blizzard when I posted it? Forum post removed and marked as Trolling with a warning sent to my forum account.

It's time to find a new game. Blizz doesn't care about you or your opinion. And the opinions they care about? The people who actually don't understand the game but just toe the line and get nerd angry when someone points out legitimately stupid decisions. Much luck to you all. I already took my 800 billion subscribers to some game better than this one that I also made up but probably will still anger blizzard and it's small minded defenders.

\---

Hello there! I am a master LiLi player on an alt account so I totally know what I’m talking about and have played this  game since it’s launch date and once was a HoTS developer and now play  on a nationally ranked team and I make $100k a year from my youboob hots  instructional videos and have my own line of personalized gamer office  chairs and once saw Carbot make a drawing in person at my breakfast  table when he woke up from his kidnapping.

So now that we have established my bonafides I have the following expert level feedback to give the devs:

WTF, mate?

in valley girl speak - I am so totally not understanding these LiLi changes.

You took one of the most underrated but secretly fun healers and basically destroyed the one thing that made her powerful; a skill that most people didn’t attribute enough credit to: the ability to spec for consecutive blinds, and the ability to have one of those blinds hit enemy heroes at twice LiLi's casting range by casting cloud serpent on a forward ally.

Most new (or dare I say, stupid? … Apparently yes, I shall dare it) players don’t give enough consideration to the damage caused by auto attacks.

But many of us (as I already established in my first paragraph and reiterated by hinting I grew up in the valley so therefore know everything) expert level players know that consistent focused auto attacks change the level of play from standard bronze through gold play to true high level play by squeezing in as much dps as possible. Shutting down auto attacks by blinding has always been an undervalued skill in this game - and LiLi  was that one character that enjoyed a special niche. She was considered  sucky by players who didn’t know better - but in the right hands of  someone who understood how to time her cloud serpent blind and vortex blind consecutively, could shut down a huge amount of enemy team damage regardless of almost any team composition.  And she was NOT overly powerful. She was very well balanced. She was easy for new players, but not too powerful as they continued to learn -  and she had plenty of counters.

in a skilled players hands, old LiLi could be super fun and a true menace. And a sort of swiss army knife of healers because she could put out the dps when needed and really throw some amazing saves with her healing ult and consecutive blinds all while staying at a respectable distance and not having to take much damage herself.

This new LiLi? I don’t know this beeyatch. She ain’t the LiLi I love.  She ain’t even flexing panda power AT ALL. Chen is ASHAMED to know her.  And I mean… WHY? She was FINE. What are ya’ll smoking at blizz HQ and can I get some for my next streaming session where I rape kids for their parents money to watch me play hots? Because that’s the kind of stupid stoned these parents need to be to let their kids watch any sort of stream I might think of making and clearly the sort of stupid stoned you must have been when implementing these changes.

If you haven’t gathered by now, I don’t like the new LiLI. I know all the previous text above didn’t quite convey that message so here I am spelling it out in pwain engrish.

Love you. Mean it. Change her back.

Yours truly,  
That one guy you know who secretly is the best player ever but can’t identify himself for contractual reasons and may or may not be Ninja but with better hair."

heroesofthestorm,Personal future balance patch wishlist,"Latest patch was great I think the new balance guy really made some really interesting changes and I love them. It's bold and meaningful.

Here are some of my personal changes that I would like to see.

Dehaka - rework with some sort of uncapped quest like butcher and zul jin have because he is all about evolution and should be in that bunch that get insanely strong as the game gets longer

Malfurion - rework to how his healing works constantly trying to keep seeds active gets annoying or at least make it a talent branch si that we can choose slightly different style of healing

Greymane - ability to stay in wolf form and have mount in wolf form (he could gain speed or go on all fours) mount would be talent and act similar to rehgar where damage would not unmount you. It could be lvl1 talent and have build that revolves around you staying in wolf form having some bonuses after certain time spent in it at the cost of not having ranged attacks from human form

Li Ming - any form of rework for tal rasha

With this new account I started playing one hero only and win a lot of my games with most of them MVP. I ended up Silver 2 for loosing the last game of 3. My first games earned me around 500 pts progressively declining game after game to hover around 200 pts despite solid performance. At some point I was forced (due to poor draft) to play two heroes I never played on this account and was awarded an additional 20 pts at game end (#220 pts).  I was wondering how the MMR works right now with the hero lvl?

Also what seeding is used to place you in SL?

Thanks!"
heroesofthestorm,Hero Suggestion because I'm super bored and don't feel like writing my thesis paper: the Marauder!,"So it's been a while since I've made one of these, but I'm trying to procrastinate my schoolwork as much as possible so here we go: the Marauder. I can't think of a name so it's called the Marauder for now. If you can think of any canon marauders that are important characters, then go for it in the comments, but I couldn't remember any. I usually make assassins and healers so today I wanted to try a tank. Let's see how it goes! And yes, I'm aware aesthetically it looks probably too similar to Blaze but eh, why not try anyways. \`\\\_(ツ)\_/\`

**ROLE: AA TANK**

**PASSIVE: Alloy Armor**

\-The Marauder starts the game with 30 armor at all times. This value can be increased and decreased with talents, similar to Alarak's Sadism trait. In addition, the Marauder's basic attacks have 25% increased range, but 15% reduced fire rate.

**ABILITY 1: Shell Swapper**

\-The Marauder, similar to Fenix's firing modes, has 2 ammo types to switch between that affect his basic attacks: Shrapnel and Concussive. Shrapnel deals a %age of its damage in an area around the primary target, and Concussive slows the target by 30%.

**ABILITY 2: Stimpack**

\-On activation, the Marauder gains a large boost to movement and attack speed, but costs 10% of your maximum health to use. After the effects end, the Marauder regenerates that health cost back over the course of 5 seconds.

**ABILITY 3: Charge Shot**

\-When activated, the Marauder's next basic attack deals double damage and has an increased range. The current affect of Shell Swapper is also doubled on this attack; when on concussive, it slows by 60%, and if on shrapnel, deals full damage to nearby enemies with increased blast radius.

**HEROIC 1: Orbital Bombardment**

\-The Marauder tosses a flare to the target location. After 1 second, a ring shows and an orbital bombardment begins on the area for 7 seconds, dropping projectiles that explode in random locations. (Think Gul'Dan's ""Rain of Destruction"" but in a more focused area that doesn't require a constant channel.) These explosions deal heavy damage and slightly slow enemies hit.

**HEROIC 2: Grenadier**

This heroic has both an active and passive part.

PASSIVE: Removes the fire rate reduction from the Marauder's passive. Increases damage of basic attacks by 10%.

ACTIVE: The Marauder channels briefly to load up his grenade tanks, before going into a frenzy for 10 seconds. During this frenzy the Marauder has doubled attack speed and becomes unstoppable.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY:** The Marauder fulfills the role of an AA tank, meaning that almost his entire kit has some influence on basic attacks. He gets almost immediately countered by blinds such as Cassia or Johanna, as these blinds stop him from dealing damage or landing CC with the concussive shells present with Shell Swapper. He has enough bullying power with Stimpack, but due to its health cost it requires correct timing and thought before using in teamfights. His Shrapnel shells work not only against clumped groups of heroes but also as a semi-effective way of waveclearing. His charge shot offers both an effective poke and a great finishing move on fleeing targets. Both Orbital Bombardment and Grenadier offer high damage capability, but each in a different way; Grenadier is much more precise and offers the player more control over where the damage goes. Orbital Bombardment, however, can be combo'd with heroes like Zarya, Tassadar, Leoric, or anyone else with high-CC heroics. I decided to forgo the ""Talents"" section for this post and probably will going forward, but if you have any original ideas for some leave them down below, along with any feedback.

heroesofthestorm,Queue times from SEA (playing in America server),"Just started game, played quick play to reach level 50.

Started playing ranked matches but I could barely get any games.

Queue times are horrible. I'm in queue for 45 mins and above and still no games. Are the player population so low that games are impossible?  


Have another monitor set up to watch streams. Here I am watching streamers queue rank games in Hots and they get instant or less than 5mins. wtf is going on? Is it because the region I'm from barely plays Ranked?"
heroesofthestorm,What is so good about new Li Li,"Hi there. So everyone is now talking about how Li Li got some huge buffs, but when I read the patch notes I didn't feel like she got that better. I obviously have to be underestimating or completely missing something, so I'd like to share my first impressions on the changes so someone can tell me what did I get wrong.

Please, do not take this as me claiming that this is how good or bad these changes really are. This is just my subjective opinion and I'd actually like someone to correct me on the things I'm wrong about.

*Blinding Wind \[E\] Additional functionality: Slows enemies hit by 15% for 1.5 seconds.*  
So this is obviously a pretty big buff. It would be huge if the old Wind Serpent still existed, but even without that it's still a really nice buff.

*Serpent Sidekick \[W\] New functionality: Cloud Serpent no longer costs Mana and while Fast Feet is active its cooldown refreshes an additional 75% faster.*  
Ok, this is the first thing that I think is actually a nerf. Afaik the 75% cooldown speed should stack additively with Fast Feet, so it is actually 1 - 1.5/2.25 = 33% CDR if you had Fast Feet active all the time. The old talent gave you so much extra duration that you could have 2 – 3 serpents at once, with the new talent it will be rather 1 – 2 serpents.

*Wind Serpent \[W\] New functionality: Cloud Serpent grants it bearer 10% increased Move Speed. Casting Blinding Wind increases this bonus to 20% for 3 seconds. Passive: Cloud Serpent attacks 25% faster.*  
The new Wind Serpent looks like a very cool talent. According to the wiki the serpent has actually 25% reduced attack timer, so it attacks 33% faster. This could somewhat make up for the Serpent Sidekick nerf. The 10% – 20% movement speed for 1 – 2 looks really nice and can be very impactful. But is it better than the old Wind Serpent? I don't know.

*Let's Go! \[Active\] Healing amount increased from 140 to 160.*  
A small buff to the already best talent, nothing more to say here, I guess.

*Lightning Serpent \[W\] Moved from level 7. Bounce attack no longer requires Heroic targets.*  
I always used to skip Lightning Serpent in the serpent build just because how strong Let's Go is. Now it's on level 13 so I can pick it now. The other talents have been indirectly nerfed by the Wind Serpent change, so they seem a lot weaker despite their small changes. Overall I think that level 13 will not be as big power spike as before.

*Blessings Of Yu'lon \[W\] New functionality: Cloud Serpent grants its bearer 10% increased healing received and heals them for 0.5% of their maximum health each time it attacks.*  
The serpent targets get 10% increased healing recieved, but in my opinion it's enough to compensate for the fact that the 1% max hp heal has been cut in half. Now the serpents attack faster, but you'll not have as many of them. I think this talent is a bit weaker.

*Shake It Off (Trait) New unctionality: Gain 35 Armor while Stunned, Silenced, or Rooted. Passive: Increase Fast Feet's cooldown refresh bonus to 75%.*  
Finally this talent. I don't think that extra 25% cooldown speed for Fast Feet and 35 armor while hard cc-ed is nearly as good as other lvl20 talents like Mistweaver or Jug upgrade, so I don't think this change may have a big impact. I can be wrong of course.

Overall I definitely do think that Li Li was buffed. The baseline E buff definitely looks more impactful than the serpent talent changes that I see as a slight nerf and there is also that nice little buff to her cleanse. However, I'm really curious about what did I miss or underestimate because everyone is talking about this patch being a really big buff to her. Maybe the movement speed on her serpent is huge and is much better than extra blind. Or maybe the serpent build is not her strongest and it's the buffs to her earlygame Fast Feet talents that make her so good, I don't know.

That's why I'm making this thread, I'd love to see other people's opinions that are a bit more specific than simply judging her overall strength."
heroesofthestorm,Infinite Scalers,"Hey Everyone,

Relatively new to HoTs, so I am wondering if any heroes have an infinite scaling mechanic? Kind of like on a long enough game, Malfs treant can reach silly numbers if the damage talent is taken, but is there any more talents which aren't really capped?"
heroesofthestorm,How to improve the Micro?,"For context, I'm usually floating around plat 1 dia 5 and recently my wife started playing. She never played a moba before and she's been playing pretty good considering her experience, IMO.   
Her macro is on point but her micro really has room for improvement but I'm not sure how to help her with that.   


The most obvious thing to me is watch replays and point things she could have done but overall situations are very unique and I'm not sure how much that helps. I belive she needs to improve both in theory and execution of micro so any tips on both how improve the micro or how to help her improve the micro are very welcomed!  


Thanks a lot in advance!"

heroesofthestorm,What killed HOTS?,"I remember playing since beta, and the game had huge hypes and projections regarding the MOBA scene, but it never took off and were always greatly dwarfed by DOTA and LoL in terms of Esports and raw player base. 

My assumption is Blizzard had the game down with graphics, diversity of maps, spells and the best part, the established heroes it encompassed throughout all their franchises. The one big downfall I saw along with the opinion of every single player I've played with was the shared XP system. It seems like Blizzard differentiated itself too far in that regards, and driven a lot of players off. All my friends I've tried poaching to HOTS quit the game due to shared XP, they'll test the game out for couple days and never come back or the ones that do stay, phase themselves out to LoL.

I personally played HOTS over other MOBAs even recently, but I do think the general quality of games would improve drastically if the XP wasn't shared based off of my experience of climbing from gold - masters on the 3 MOBAs I've mentioned. Main thing I see is people are much more YOLO in HOTS games and have disregard for their deaths compared to other MOBAs, which in turn brings the overall quality of HOTS games down. This make it extremely difficult for individual players to carry or cover that hole, since the team is being dragged down as a whole, which in turns makes the game much more one sided. Like the amount of one sided games I have on HOTS with no comebacks compared to DOTA and LoL is very noticeable. 

What do you guys think were the main catalysts that's driven HOTS to the current state?"
heroesofthestorm,Has ARAM match making changed?,"Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed more games in ARAM where your team does not have a tank option at all, but the enemy ends up with a tank, or a healer?

I went back through a replay and checked what the enemy team had for selection and they had 3 tanks and our team had no tanks for options. 

Is this recent or has this always been the case?"
heroesofthestorm,Mal'Ganis blind as a bat is so fun now,"With the new patch, Mal'Ganis has gone from a neat albeit weak tank to probably my favorite tank in the game, and a large part of this is blind as a bat. While there were several changes to the talent, as well as a damage buff to the underlying skill, I would like to bring up my favorite buff across all stat and talent changes.

* No longer sets Fel Claws on cooldown when it expires.

Positioning on blind as a bat can be somewhat dicey, and often reckless. Having fel claws automatically on cooldown previously often left you stranded and meant the most reliable use was as an emergency escape tool, which just isn't as fun as using hp pings and intuition to track enemies. I understand changes/nerfs sometimes prove necessary, especially as numerous small buffs add up, but if blind as a bat gets any further patches, I implore the devs keep this change."
heroesofthestorm,What are the WORST talents in the game?,"What are some the worst talents in the game that you believe are in need of some serious love?

Off the top of my head: 

Butcher: Insatiable Blade

Ana: Vampiric Rounds

Stukov: level 20

Falstad: Gathering Storm &amp; Hinterlands

Zeratul: Darkness Descends

Malthael: Tormented Souls (minus Nano)"
heroesofthestorm,Patch 84249 Hotfix Changes (Datamined),"These changes are datamined, my interpretation could be wrong. Test and verify yourself.

- Fixed an issue where Falstad's Dishonorable Discharge quest talent would stack on non-heroic units.
- Fixed an issue where Falstad's Frequent Flier active talent would not queue properly.
- Fixed an issue where Tyrael's Bound by Law talent would heal on non-heroic units.
- Fixed an issue where Tyrael's Archangel's Wrath Death Timer reduction would trigger on non-heroic units.
- Fixed an issue where Alexstrasza's Lifeblossom talent would incorrectly modify the health cost in certain situations.
- Fixed an issue where Mephisto's Durance of Hate heroic ability had a shorter cast time than intended.
- Fixed an issue where Mephisto's Skull Missile ability would not correctly queue after unlocking the second charge."
heroesofthestorm,Should Tracer's Ricochet effect be activable ?,"The changes to the structures targeting priority have made Ricochet too much of a risky talent: if you hit a structure with a basic attack, and a nearby enemy hero is hit by the effect of ricochet, the structure will start hitting Tracer.

So I think it would be great to have the opportunity to disable the ricochet effect while attacking a structure, just like you can disable a spell shield to save it for a big damage threat."
heroesofthestorm,Please stop DVA's Liquid Cooling from changing back every time I call mech,"So for some weird reason I've never been comfortable with pressing the 1 key in mobas so most of the time I change talents/items to the 2 key and onwards. This is fine since most mobas including HotS allow you to easily change the key by just drag and dropping the talent to the desired key. The problem is when I play DVA and choose Liquid cooling at lvl 1, everytime I lose the mech and call it back the key bind is changed back to 1. Probably a minor thing but its kind of annoying and seems like an oversight."
heroesofthestorm,Tyrael - Ardent Restoration,"I'm trying to understand the talent. In the text it says ""Dealing damage to a hero heals tyrael for X health over 5 seconds. Dealing damage resets this timer, and the heal amount stacks up to 10 times.""

Does that mean that if X amount was 40 health over 5 seconds it could stack up to 400 health over 5 seconds?"
heroesofthestorm,Thoughts on ban for verbal abuse,"I got banned for abusive language. I'm not here to say that it's bullshit. I'm not here to say I didn't deserve it. I definitely had it coming. I'm was pretty toxic. It was deserved.

**I'll get straight to the point and start with my suggestion.** I think the community would be better served by a change of policy where the players who would be permanently banned for abusive language are instead only permanently muted and banned only from ranked (since you want teammates who can communicate).

**A bit of background.** I don't play ranked. At the time I got banned, I had more loot boxes than I can count. I just didn't open them anymore. I don't really care that I lost skins, unlocks, and levels. Those things didn't really matter to me. I don't play ranked. I do a lot of QM and ARAM. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I honestly don't really care all that much about the stuff I lost on that account; I'm still playing the game and not noticing a difference aside from the missing skins. I lost a grand total of maybe $50, which was spent before 2.0.

In the matches where I'd be verbally abusive, I never did anything like throw the game on purpose. I mostly just insulted people. The games where Blizz muted me were actually better because I couldn't type and had to focus on playing.

**What's my point?** What I'm trying to get at is that by banning me, Blizzard actually made me have even less inhibition when it comes to being toxic. I obviously still play the game on a smurf account, just as much as I did before. The only difference is that now, what little incentive (in the form of being able to play with skins, all heroes unlocked, etc.) I had to control myself and keep my mouth shut is gone. I can 100% say that I'm more verbally abusive than before. You probably think I'm an asshole, and you're probably right, but that's besides the point.

The bottom line is that Blizzard made the problem worse by banning me. I realize that I may be part of a very small minority where this kind of action would be preferable since it mostly makes sense for someone who would be OK with playing on an account where chat and ranked are permanently disabled, and therefore would have no reasons to try and circumvent the ban... But I can't imagine I'm the only one who doesn't play ranked and has a similar story. If I had been permanently muted instead, I'd still be playing on that account and raging quietly to myself, as I managed to do in some of the games where I didn't type anything, or when I was temporary muted.

I legitimately just think that the community would be better served by Blizzard permanently muting players who get banned as a result of verbal abuse. Again - this isn't about my own account. I'd be perfectly happy if my own experience can maybe cause a change of policy going forward and currently-banned accounts remain banned. This is really just a matter of taking the most sensible action to make the community a better place. Muting a player like myself permanently would have improved the lives of the players I get matched with in the future.

heroesofthestorm,can we have disable autoattack button?,"I know I can use hold position but its not as good, not even close.
I can not bealive that a game this old does not have that option.
also perhaps target champions only toggle?
playing adcs in this game is so messy beacuse of lack of this option
I've been thru this reddit and no1 even seems to be requesting it? 
I did find my own post from 10 months ago tho"
heroesofthestorm,Intro video!,So I’ve been playing heroes for years. I got a new hard drive the other day and re-installed heroes today. I had forgotten how crazy good this video is! Make me get that warm feeling inside watching it. Just wondering if anyone else remembers the feeling you got the first time you saw it?
heroesofthestorm,New hotfix patch live on NA,2.53.2.84249
heroesofthestorm,Today is Leoric's favorite day of the year!,The damned March 4th.
heroesofthestorm,To new and and old players of HotS,"Greetings to all players of HotS! 

I'm glad you're in the nexus enjoying the game and trying out all the heroes, but please take a peek down at the mini-map once in a while. I've noticed in quite a few games that one or two teammates are oblivious to objectives or plays that could've turned the match had they just been a tad bit more aware. Now I know some might say that they might just not give a ****, but I choose to believe that they're just so focused on their awesome hero that certain things escape them

So whether you're new to the game or a long-time lover who's focusing on learning new heroes during the ""all heroes are free"" period, show your teammates a little love by showing them that you're paying attention to what is happening during the game.

Hope to see you in the nexus!


Noz"
heroesofthestorm,[SERIOUS] Do we have any idea how many people are still working on HotS?,"I've seen a bunch of different rumors floating around but nothing definitive or sourced. This was asked [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/f7nd4z/how_big_is_the_heroes_dev_team/), when /u/jjp3 [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/f7nd4z/how_big_is_the_heroes_dev_team/fid84ke?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/zRLT3sJ.jpg) of the current dev team, then around 30 (and a DOG). 

So...anyone know? Can we tell from LinkedIn profiles (I don't have a LinkedIn, so I'm not sure and can't use it)? Any other ideas?"
heroesofthestorm,03/04/2021 8pm patch ?,"any idea what this patch is? I've been looking around couldn't find anything. Was trying to queue in SL but it said i couldn't play SL with the version i had, i exited the game and it downloaded a patch."
heroesofthestorm,"Balance ideas brought on by salt, part 10","* Zagara's creep are no longer invisible.  
* Zagara's damage against heroes is reduced by 50%   
* Damage sustained by rooted/stunned heroes is reduced by 100% for the duration of the stun/root.   
* Iceblock abilities now work like Chen's Stagger.  
* Kael'thas can no longer cast Living Bomb twice on a row on the same enemy (this include his level 16 talent that automatically applies Living Bomb on the enemy)  
* If D.va is carrying something (turret, nuke, gems, etc...), being de-meched makes her lose the item(s) 
* Qhira can still be targeted and take damage while spinning around an enemy.  
* Sylvanas's trait lower the damage of her target by 50% rather than completely disabling minions/structures.  
* Valeera now can only enter stealth if at least 1 second after taking damage has passed."
heroesofthestorm,Highlight votes from the other team,"Surely this has been suggested before: mark the votes you receive at the end if they're from the opposing team. No need for names or anything fancy/risky, just a special coloring or something to let people know you earned some respect from your opponents.

I think it would add to the feeling of sportsmanship in HotS, and I honestly don't see any downsides to it."
heroesofthestorm,Bug report: groups are bugged for Storm League,People keep showing up invisible or as T:0456004456
heroesofthestorm,A Suggestion For Valeera's Thistle Tea Talent,"They've buffed Thistle Tea many times, but people still aren't really using it, and the winrate is mediocre compared to the other level 16 talents. I have a suggestion that I (as a dedicated Valeera main) think would help to fix the issues with this talent: to make it reset Q and W cooldowns for Valeera. 

When Valeera tries to opener-&gt;QWE, it dumps her Energy yes, but it also leaves her with W on cooldown, which is by far the most Energy intensive ability she has. Thistle Tea doesn't help me very much here, unless you skipped Relentless Strikes at 4 and need the Energy for your Q spam (in which case you've gone until level 16 with horrible Energy problems). It just doesn't make a lot of sense for her. Thistle Tea in my form, however, would enable her to use her W again  (which makes Fatal Finesse, another underperforming talent, more appealing as well), and also gives Valeera a way to compensate for a missed Q. Another cool thing this would do is  help non-Mutilate Valeera be more viable, as the double Q is quite meaningful mobility.

Obviously, opener-&gt;QWE-&gt;tea-&gt;QWE is going to be fairly powerful burst, so we may want to increase the cooldown back to 40 or 60 seconds. Still, Q build will remain better for sustained damage, so I doubt it will pose a major balance issue. I think Seal Fate typically remains a better level 16 talent for full Q build for the most skilled players due to the extra combo point generation. But the important thing is that this gives Thistle Tea a clear use case for certain builds."

heroesofthestorm,Creating SL Team (Bronze ONLY),"EDIT: You're right... It's 4...

Contact in-game Enji#11350Spots open: 4

Alright, so here’s the deal – real sick of sitting in Bronze, so I’m starting a team.Looking for members to join me. *BRONZE ONLY***Here are the requirements**:**You must have a level of maturity which one could only describe as “humbled”**.  Don’t think you’re never the reason the game went poorly, it totally  could be, and you must be willing to accept that, conversely, NO ONE on  this team will judge you for it.**A general working knowledge of the maps and their timings**, best (or better than your opponents) pathing (I really can’t stress this one enough, pathing is everything).**Decent knowledge of heroes and their counters**. It’s  totally cool if you don’t know every single counter to every single  hero, cause in my opinion, every hero can, in SOME fashion, go toe to  toe with the other – which brings me to my next point**The ability to adapt talent choices according to enemy composition**.**Macro/Micro**. I’m using these terms as if it were  StarCraft. Macro for map, Micro for the Hero (I know they somehow got  altered or redefined for this game but… I view them as such, and I think  it keeps things simpler and easier)**Macro**: Eyes on map, watch for rotations, yellow needs blue and so on.**Micro**: Quick fingers and a snappy wrist. If you don’t  use auto-cast, you will. If you don’t know how to self-cast, you will.  We’re looking at the minutiae of spell casting, auto-attacks, picking  talents while moving, everything.So far these are all (mostly) gameplay requirements.Now for you.Honestly, you must be able to take **constructive criticism**.  I, if anyone knows me, am extremely critical. I’ll admit it. But, I am a  firm believer that if someone doesn’t point out what you’ve done wrong,  you WILL continue to make that same mistake, over, and over, and over  again - because no one wants to be wrong, everyone believes they’re  right (most of the time), in my experience. You must be able to take the  **CONSTRUCTIVE** (**there will never be harsh words thrown at ANYONE**) **CRITICISM**, and LEARN from it.As far as attitude goes, I want nothing to do with anyone who thinks  they’re better than anyone else. Or that guy who thinks that the game is  won with giant numbers. You win this game by strategy. That big number,  yeah it might be big but… Here’s something for you to chew on:D.va’s been chompin’ away at Stitches all game long and Stitches goes  and heals himself instantly for quarter health. All that damage actually  just cancels itself out and just becomes… A pretty painting on the  wall. It’s nothing. It contributed nothing. However, one good  Assassinate(combined with Ambush to reduce armor) into Mutilate from  Valeera, and you’ve either instantly killed a mage, or completely taken  an enemy hero out of combat. Meanwhile D.va is still auto attacking  stitches, inflating her numbers thinking she’s a way better player than  Valeera. If you are D.va, you will have no place on this team. If your  mind works like Valeera, you are more than welcome."
heroesofthestorm,Can you get rid of the blue light that goes over your character when you press space?,"Title basically. I like holding space when I play and moving the camera when necessary (I don't like camera lock, don't really know why but I can't use it). Maybe pressing space just gives my thumb something to do? Not sure, but anyways is it possible to make it so when I'm holding space the blue beam isn't there?"
heroesofthestorm,"The worst teammates I've ever gotten in a QM, just had to share...","One was a Leoric who someone got behind the enemy walls, all the way to the enemy Nexus before the first walls were even down yet. I still don't know how he did this. But because of Leorics trait, he was stuck there the entire game and just kept dying.

The second one was a TLV player literally named VIKINGSxFEED. He left 2 minutes in. I can't even fathom how sad this persons real life must be for them to dedicate time and energy to something like that.

Can't say I was even mad. I laughed at the sheer insanity of the situation. QM never change. Shoutout to the Auriel and Nazeebo for hanging in there but there was 0 chance of us being able to win that game.

Anyways feel free to share similar QM horror stories. I'm sure this one isn't even as bad in comparison."
heroesofthestorm,Strange bug making the game unplayable for minor regions.,"There is a bug in which sometimes the default server option its just ignored.

heroesofthestorm,Why does Mephisto have Skull Missile cooldown listed at 1 Sec?,Isn't like 4 to 8 seconds cooldown? Bad talent description?
heroesofthestorm,"Blizzard, you need to clear up what is multiplicative and additive.","Falstad is a good example of this, as he's now got one additive and two multiplicative(I think it's actually nearly the worst example) on one Lightning Rod.

The baseline description says ""Deals 100% increased damage to Minions and Mercenaries"", this is an additive bonus.

Dishonorable Discharge says ""After 3 Lightning Rod strikes, subsequent strikes on enemy Heroes increases its damage by 1%, up to 75%."", this is a multiplicative bonus.

Thunderstrikes says ""Lightning Rod deals 20% more damage each subsequent strike"", this is a multiplicative bonus, EDIT: but not with itself, to clear that up

Another example, Lunara with Choking Pollen. It's almost worse.

""Noxious Blossom deals 100% more damage to enemies afflicted by Nature's Toxin, increased to 150% against enemies with 3 stacks""

That initial 100% more damage is multiplicative, while that additional 50% more damage is additive. One talent, two different forms of damage bonus. EDIT: Just to clear things up, this only ends up mattering if there are other damage effects at play, as the extra 50% is actually an extra 25%, which because the base is a 100% bonus, that becomes 50% when compared to non-Choking Pollen version of this effect.

Orphea, her basic attack &amp; trait + talents:

""While Orphea has Chaos, her Basic Attacks against Heroes consume all Chaos, dealing 50% increased damage per stack, and healing..."", that's a multiplicative bonus(but it gets messier!)

Chaotic Assault, ""Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes while having 3 stacks of Chaos deal an additional 75% bonus damage"", this is essentially increasing the bonus damage from her trait by 75%, so it's multiplicative, but not with Overflowing Chaos.

Determination, ""...While Orphea has Determination, her Physical Damage is increased by 15%""

Probius, Rift Shock ""Hitting an enemy Hero with Warp Rift explosion increases Probius's daamge against them by 20% for 10 seconds."", multiplicative(BTW, Construct More Pylons still adds 4 damage to Pylon Overcharge. Reported that in May last year, alongside a load of other things)

Zarya, her energy ""Each point of Energy increases Zarya's damage by 2%"", this is a multiplicative bonus.

Greymane, ""While Worgen, Greymane gains 10 Armor, and his Basic Attacks become melee but deal 40% more damage"", this is multiplicative

So that's a few of the multiplicative bonuses, just to get the wording out there. Sometimes it's more damage, sometimes it is additional damage, and in the cases of where it's actually done right, it's a numerical bonus, [like you see on Hanzo's Dragonstrike](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes-of-the-storm/22647956/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-november-13-2018#Design). That change in that patch note was brought about by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/67byqn/talents_and_abilities_that_interact_with/)

This is not a complete list - I at one point had one, but that is over 2 years old now. Some that I remember from them that are still the case off are as follows: Jaina's Wintermute(for balance, this should be multiplicative), Tychus's Focusing Diodes, Nova's Holo Decoy(balance), Nova's Anti-Armor Shells(btw, armor application order still fucked here and on Hanzo's 7), Samuro's Harsh Winds, Valla's Vault+Death Dealer(this uses its own system entirely, probably needs to this way for balance), Tassadar's Khaydarin Amulet(previously Prismatic Link), Arthas Biting Cold, Li-Ming's Zei's Vengeance and Valeera's Assassinate

That's likely not a complete list, like it doesn't have Hogger's Hogg Wild."
heroesofthestorm,So patch today. Did they really hotfix Durance of Hate on Meph?,"Description, I went into try mode and looks like Durance no longer has a .75 delay.

How come it was a bug when the tooltip was changed too, unless it was an internal thing the devs werent aware of after patch went live.

Sad cause I was missing less with this ult too 😂 Oh well.

I'm also aware Falstad W stacking  and Tychus was changed too, wonder what else was hotfixed?"
heroesofthestorm,"[Hero Concept] Cairne Bloodhoof, Tauren Chieftain (Tank)","ETC shouldn't be the only Tauren in the game. We gotta show respect to the first Tauren we ever met, the elderly Cairne.

---

[""Ish-ne-alo por-ah""](https://www.deviantart.com/glennraneart/art/Cairne-Bloodhoof-156446003)

#**General Design**
&gt;Cairne is a defensive Tank/Support hybrid designed to shepherd critical allies, peeling dangerous enemies away from them and even redirecting damage an ally would take onto Cairne himself. Cairne makes for an excellent ""bodyguard"" tank, but isn't as well-suited to initiating fights as other tanks. In the correct composition, he can make it almost impossible for the enemy to pick off a crucial ally.

**Pros**

* Excellent peel
* Durable
* Good crowd control
* Good teamfight sustain
* Decent waveclear

**Cons**

* Large target
* Limited reach with abilities
* Lacks escape mechanisms
* Lackluster initiation
* Poor single-target damage
* Vulnerable to healing-reduction effects

---

#**Abilities**

*(subject to change)*

**Trait - Reincarnate**  
&gt;Upon taking fatal damage, Cairne enters stasis for a few seconds and then reincarnates with a portion of his health and mana. Cairne can still move while Reincarnating, but is slowed for the duration. Upon finishing, Cairne knocks back all nearby enemies. Reincarnate has a long cooldown, but this can be reduced by hitting enemy Heroes with Cairne's basic attacks and basic abilities. When an enemy forces Cairne to Reincarnate, they still receive 1/4 of a takedown in experience.

**Q - Shockwave**  
&gt;Cairne sends a shockwave in a target direction that damages and slows all enemies in a wide line. Mediocre range.

**W - War Stomp**  
&gt;After a short delay, Cairne stomps the ground, damaging and stunning all nearby enemies. Cairne is healed for each enemy Hero he hits with War Stomp.

**E - Spirit Link**  
&gt;Cairne links himself to target allied Hero for a limited time. As long as the link holds, a large percentage of any damage dealt to the target ally by enemy Heroes is redirected to Cairne. Cairne regenerates a portion of any damage taken via Spirit Link over a few seconds. The link will break early if Cairne is too far away from his ally, and cancels if Cairne is below 5% of his maximum health. Cairne cannot take lethal damage from Spirit Link.

**R1 - Ancestral Spirit**  
&gt;Cairne summons a Tauren Spirit that periodically heals all allied heroes around it. Cairne can reactivate the ability to redirect the Tauren Spirit. The Tauren Spirit can be destroyed by the enemy.

**R2 - Earthen Ring**  
&gt;After a wind-up, Cairne slams the ground, vacuuming all nearby enemies toward him and dealing modest damage. He then creates an impassable ring around him that functions like terrain. Cairne can move freely through the ring.

---

#**Talents**

_(expect changes, please suggest ideas)_

**Stampede**  
After casting War Stomp, Cairne periodically releases shockwaves that damage nearby enemies.

**Siphoning Link**  
Cairne is healed for a portion of any damage dealt to enemy Heroes by a Spirit-Linked ally.

**Deep Link**  
*Quest*: Each Regen Globe collected increases the effect of Spirit Link by 0.5%, up to a 15% bonus.

**Distant Link** (level 16)  
Increases the range of Spirit Link.

**Chain Link** (level 20)  
Spirit Link now chains to an additional ally near its target, redirecting damage to Cairne at halved effectiveness on the secondary target.

**Spirit Stomp** (level 16)  
An untalented War Stomp is also cast at the location of a Spirit-Linked ally.

**Wide Stomp**  
Increases the radius of War Stomp.

**Pulverize**  
Every X attacks, Cairne will slam the ground, dealing area damage and briefly slowing all enemies hit.

**Endurance Aura**  
Cairne and his linked ally receive bonus attack speed. Cairne also receives an activated ability that temporarily provides bonus movement speed to him and his linked ally.

**Weakening Wave**  
Enemy Heroes hit by Shockwave deal reduced damage for a short time.

**Fracturing Wave**  
Whenever an enemy Hero is hit by Shockwave, it releases two additional miniature waves that deal less damage.

**Forceful Wave**  
The first enemy hit by Shockwave is briefly stunned.

**Mudslide**  
Shockwave leaves behind a path of mud that slows enemies who stand in it.

**Greater Ancestral Spirit** (level 20)  
Ancestral Spirit gains increased health and heals more frequently.

**Ethereal Ring** (level 20)  
Reduces the cooldown of Earthen Ring and allows allied units to pass through the ring freely.

**Bond with the Earth Mother** (level 20)  
Increase the rate at which basic attacks and abilities reduce the cooldown on Reincarnate. Reincarnate now restores Cairne to full health and mana.

---

**Hero Synergy**  
&gt;Cairne would synergize well with high-priority allies who need someone to peel for them. Good examples would be Sgt. Hammer, Raynor, or Zul'jin. However, Cairne doesn't synergize all too well with highly-mobile allies like Tracer or Genji, as they can easily get too far away from him for his Spirit Link to do any good. Cairne also shouldn't be counted on to initiate fights for his team, as his lack of a gap-closer would greatly hinder his ability to do so. Heroes with siege capability like Azmodan are good teammates, lessening the need for initiators.

**Hero Counters**  
&gt;Cairne is vulnerable to being separated from his team, as he can't rejoin them that quickly and his Spirit Link requires that he remain close enough to an ally for it to work. Stukov, Stitches, and Garrosh can all make things difficult for Cairne by displacing him or his teammate. Being a health-centric tank, he's also vulnerable to attacks that deal a percentage of his health. As such, Malthael and Tychus are very effective against him. Any effects that reduce healing can also hurt for Cairne, who relies on healing to keep himself in the fight, so Ana can be a big problem. Finally, any hero who can trap Cairne while he's Reincarnating can doom him after he revives. Nazeebo, Junkrat, Malfurion and Chromie can all use their CC's to trap Cairne upon finishing his Reincarnate, even if he tries to maneuver away during the process.

Who else wants to see the old bull in action? Please leave comments."
heroesofthestorm,Changes to Chromie,"So I think the patch brought a lot of very cool changes (and bugs...)

But I would REALLY like a discussion on the changes to Chromie. Devs say they are nerfing slowing sands, and then while not touching the slow in any way, they buff the level 18? It now takes a grand total of 1,25 seconds to give a person -50 spell armor after level 18. I just had the honor of tanking a game like that, and as a supposed frontline, when you get deleted in 1,5 seconds over and over it is not a great feeling. So it is my desperate hope, that something, ANYTHING is actually done to that ult, because with its current strength, it is not being used just a zoning tool, it is being used offensively to great effect.

heroesofthestorm,"My experience with Hots, Why I left years ago, and why I question coming back","Hi everyone. I think I mostly felt the need to share my relationship with this game over the years, to be able to get a lot of things off my system and to seek for similiar experiences, and get possibly answers out of it.

I left Hots mid 2017, after having played since the closed beta release. A lot. And really, I'm not kidding, a LOT.
I have around 8000 games played. And I haven't played one since mid 2017, I played those in 2 and a half years.
Not that I brag about it, nor am I ashamed of it, it's just how much I played this game. And I loved and hated it.
And one day I decided to close the game never to launch it again. it was a decision that came out over multiple factors
that I'm gonna explain, but that's something I had been thinking for a while. I played a lot, but it never impacted my life negatively, 
I always managed to have a balance and it never got out of hand.

Well, yesterday something happenned that decided me I needed to share all of this and made me question coming back.
See I was just wandering on youtube and more or less randomly came across the Live Voices Heroes Of The Storm Acapella cover ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS__55Uuai8 ) and, wow,
I had a tiny cry that caught me off guard I didn't even know why. I just missed the experience so much. It's just a game, but it's a game that took a cumulated over 5 months of my life.
Of course I thought about playing again from time to time but I never felt such a desire to come back. It just never seemed appealing to come backafter what made me leave.

That leaves me to the reasons **why I left**.

-I'm gonna start with the most delicate part. The sooner it's said, the better. *The ladder wasn't fair*.
Yes. I know how that sounds, really I do, and I know that most people who say that are just frustrated not to be in leagues they don't deserve.
I'm not talking about my case, though, but my experience, including what I witnessed from other players.
Looking back, I often wasn't happy with my rank but... it wasn't that bad? Was usually platinium, got close to diamonds. I also got a smurf to master pretty easily but... that's kinda part of the problem. The best way to get to master was to abuse the MMR algorythm with a new accounts.
I didn't want to lose all my stuff though.

The truly main problem was the elo hell and elo heaven effects. Players tend to be matched against average players, that tend to be towards their leagues.
I haven't seen many believe in that, but it was demonstrated very easily. Bronze players have an average winrate much lower than average diamonds.
Despite being something that sounds absolutely logical, it's not when you think about who these players are supposed to match: other bronzes and other diamonds. The average winrate should be 50% in every league, yet it's not. It's because the matchmaking won't take the time to find perfectly matching opponents and instead pick something good enough. And won't compensate the rank difference with enough points.
Of course I'm not trying to open a debate about the quality of the ladder, this is a 3 years old argument and there are good chances it's  very much not valid anymore today. I have no clue. I wanted to develop this point a little bit, because, as someone who's been in all leagues, I didn't see much of a difference between gold and diamond leagues.

-*It ate up my time*. As I said, I managed to find a good balance between my life and Hots despite achieving an average of 4/5 hours a day for over 2 years, but that means I haven't played any other game in those years. Or barely. As someone who loves video games, it's kinda sad. I needed to see something else, and I knew playing less wasn't even close to be an option.

-What made mde actually take the final decision: *The Infinite Ammo tower patch*. Boy, this patch was NOT welcomed well. i didn't take me long to make the decision that if this patch was getting out of the RPT, I would just quit. It was such a terrible decision to render all push strategy worthless, to make so many heroes instantly trash tier. I remember most people were against it making it to live.
But it went live. And honestly, it was such a relief. It gave me that exit door I needed to leave Hots. I probably could've trusted that
they would later make changes to compensate all the consequences from such a core change, but I didn't want to, I needed to leave.

-*I was beyond toxic*. I think I climbed up to a 2 month ban from Hots, although I think I remember I was able appeal it with success, it doesn't change the fact that I climbed there for a reason. Well, to be fair to myself, the system that autobans whenever you reach a  certain treshold of reports is dumb. And playing a lot does mean you're gonna get more reports. But I recognize, beyond that, I played a major role in getting those reports. Instead of accepting being matched with a bad player, I'd rather argue with him the whole game.
And, looking back, it might have played a role in my winrate. Of course when you spend your game arguing and typing you're not spending it focused on your own performance. of course there is something frustrating about trying to win a game you'll likely lose, but winning those games is exactly what makes you climb a ladder. Even a bad ladder. The bad games are the important games you're supposed to win.
It ended up, obviously, decreasing the pleasure I was getting from playing this game. The same thing happenned in Overwatch but I worked on it a lot and I think I'm at a point where I'm able to just let it go when things go the wrong way.

-*The meta/community*.
I got very tired of something that came out of ""the community""(Obviously doesn't mean nearly everyone is like that)
""This hero is good because it has a good winrate"", or ""this talent is better because pros pick it"". I rarely managed to have interesting discussions without falling on the same logical fallacies over and over again. I found that a lot of the meta was very misguided.
I remember when Ragnaros Lava had to be nerfed because players couldn't possibly learn to move a little on the side. A lot of the times players avoided niche talents/ultimates at all costs even in the niche situations they're good with. Well, one viable solution would've been to just play the game and avoid Reddit/forums but man I just love discussing things.

Now, that was the negative part. It probably sounds like I fucking hate the game. But...
Here's **what makes me consider playing again**:

-*I loved the game*.
Love is never perfect and neither was that game. But man, it's good. I do believe it had the potential to take the place of Lol in competition, if it was handled properly by Blizzard. How can a team game, focused on the teamplay, not be the most popular MOBA out there?

-*I enjoyed playing with other players*.
Especially on voice chat. It's just such a unique experience to make plans, suggest calls, succeed, fail, manage strong combos...
Never experienced that on Overwatched or any other team game. I'd focus on my game and nothing else but Hots has that thing that makes it deeper than that.

-*I enjoyed the competition*.
I probably cared a little too much about my rank. But I liked caring. It made the victories feel so much better, it made the games that more  intense, it made the defeats more crushing, but that's good. Negative feelings are emotions as well, and sometimes they can be pleasant.
I never enjoyed it in any other game. Even in Overwatch, I liked climbing but... if I didn't, eh. I cared more about the win in the moment 
than in the rank in the long term.

-*I want to see what's new*.
How has the game changed? Is it mostly the same game I left with new heroes, maps and reworks?
Has one core mechanic changed the whole aspect of the game, making it a whole different game?
Are there 30 new heroes, following the rythm from 3 years ago? only 20? 10? What are they? Have they changed the meta?
Are old trash heroes now god tier? Are old top tiers still on the top?
It's just insane to think that I spend most of Hots existance, absent of it.

-I feel like all my knowledge of the game is completely intact and my muscle memory remembers exactly how to play each hero I used to play.
If I went back in time and just played it again, I really feel like I wouldn't be lost at all. I haven't touched the game in so long 
but I feel like I wouldn't struggle with the core mechanics.

That's why I kinda consider the idea of coming back as enjoyable. But I still have reasons to **question it**.

-*I might play as much as I Used to*. 
I do have that time, but I'd rather not spend it that way.

-*I might feel really lost*.
I did miss out over 3 years of content. Maybe core mechanics changed, probably all my old mains reworked, I'm probably not gonna be able to play the way I used to. And that's kinda scary.

-*I might have to grind a LOT to unlock new content*. 
I remember how many months it took me to earn enough golds to unlock all heroes. I'm scared I might want to have everything at once and be frustrated at the grinding.
I'm actually wondering how welcoming can this game be from newcomers. I'm definitely gonna feel like a new player, with everything unlocked from
before mid 2017 (Hanzo).


Well, I feel like I said enough. Probably more than I thought I would have to say about this game.
I loved it. I feel like I want to give it a try but I'm not sure that's a good idea. I grew to hate Blizzard in some ways but, that game 
is just awesome in so many aspects.
I just needed this off my chest. I don't know if a lot will read all of that (1 person would be enough honestly) and if I'll get answers, but it feels good to be able to share my experience regardless."

I have Li Li at level 50 and played her pretty consistently since before her trait rework too (RIP ye olde kung fu hustle and shake it off, I even liked the last version of shake it off more than this one) and one of my favorite things with her was that she could be used as an off lane 1v1 bully. 

The extra blind time+AA damage at level thirteen allowed her to focus people down with assassin levels of damage while absolutely crippling other AA heroes.

It wasn't always the best choice as a healer, but when it worked it dominated. The damage negated from blinds alone made up for the lack in healing bonuses, and made her all that much more protected from dive attempts.

Auriel-Abathur-Deathwing-Nova-Samuro

&amp;#x200B;

\-The Auriel is rendered completely useless without a single viable crown target

\-Abathur can't hat Deathwing, and putting his hat on Samuro or Nova will immediately reveal the true body amongst the clones

\-Somehow this team lacks both sustained AND burst damage 

\-This team has no cc, no frontline, and no peels for Nova/Auriel

\-Their only strength is the mediocre waveclear and global presence of Abathur/Deathwing combined with the ability to abuse camps with smart play from Samuro/Nova. They might also be able to get a surprise stealth + hat kill on a lone hero, provided they don't have a single escape button (Azmodan? Cassia?)

heroesofthestorm,"11 year League of Legends veteran, met my wife on LoL, I am having a BLAST with HoTS.","Yes, really. 

So many heroes to try. So many maps to learn. So many confusing skins. So much nostalgia for pre 2010 Blizzard 

Sadly, I can tell the novelty of HoTS will wear off for me right about the time Blizzard goes back to the usual hero rotation. 

HoTS has ALWAYS been a game with a short intense Honeymoon phase followed by boredom for me all the way back to Beta. I have given this game multiple shots over the years and I bounce off time and time again.

I think I am pretty typical of the retention problem HoTS has always had. If you love HoTS and play it for years at a time I'm very happy for you. 

I have no incentive to stick around and Git Gud. I have no interest in grinding all the heroes. I have no interest in giving Activision money. I feel like I get way more reward for my effort in Dark Souls or Vermintide or LoL. 

I'll watch Khaldor while I work out to support his channel. (I feel like I give more of a shit about HoTS Esports that 99% of the playerbase?)

heroesofthestorm,"Biggest MMR Decay, come and suffer with me","Why does Blizzard insist on creating a penalty for players who do not play constantly? I have played this for many years in high elo, and I stopped doing it when Blizzard added the groups of 5 in Storm League again, because they had already done it before and it was very bad, I find it curious that knowing that it is a mistake they insist on it.

The old Team League and Hero League system has always been broken. In team league there were players with an almost perfect winrate and 12k points. In Hero League there have been many names that are known to wintrade and are usually in the top 5 GMs. I will not say names because it is against the rules of this subreddit.

But do you really think an MMR Decay system is going to help? That only encourages players who play Storm League as 5, if you can call them players, who try to be among the Grandmasters to play even more than necessary and remain a nuisance to people who try to climb the ladder playing solo. This only makes the queues longer for everyone.

I know that is not fun to play with four other strangers, when the enemy team is playing as five in a game where you can't solocarry.

I read that the developers said they don't want to further divide players into groups, those who only play Hero league and those who only play Team League. And it is true, they did not divide them, they did something worse, they are destroying them.

Now I can't even not play because my MMR goes down, but is it fun to play with all of the above?

No other competitive game allows a group of five to be paired with people playing alone. I'm not just talking about MOBAs, no other game allows this outrage.

heroesofthestorm,Idbecoolif there was counter-play to Butcher's Charge into Silence,"I get it... the hero is ""bad"". Don't let him get stacked.... pick around him...I get it.

The problem is, once he is stacked, the only literal counterplay to a Butcher Charge into Silence is either:

1. Be a hero with some sort of hard counter to being stunned (ice block, Unstoppable, Leap/ Dash, etc). Btw, if your playing QM, there is no way to preemptively pick a hero that can counter butch
2. Literally stay a screen's length away from him so he doesn't charge you and silence you.

Butcher's silence is the definition of zero counterplay. It also fundamentally breaks a core game-design axiom (that I believe Blizzard has) of being fun to PLAY AS and being fun to PLAY AGAINST. I really wish they would remove this ult from the game or severely rework it. I've heard criticism that if you remove the silence, the ult becomes bad or useless. Fine, if a rework is not possible, please remove this terrible ult from the game and replace it with something more fun and skill based. He is one of the few heroes in the game that has a ""you can no longer play the game"" ability.

Suggestions for a different ult? I'm not really sure. Maybe a longer chain that lasts longer, but does not silence you. This way you are kind of forced to engage butcher, but you actually have your hero's tools at your disposal to fight him (i.e. blinds, slows, ability dmg (lol), etc).

Maybe go a completely different direction. Maybe give him a rage type ability that makes him unblindable, increased move speed, and a bit of armor. I don't care if he's super powerful.... I just want to have a chance to counter that power.

Btw.. this game kicks ass Blizz. Love to see the new balance updates. Its time to take a chance on this game and make some wild changes! Really excited to see your new balance manager takings some risks. Hope to see plenty more!"
heroesofthestorm,Falstad's Lightning Rod Build - bugged and probably overpowered,"Hey guys, I played a dozen or so games as Falstad tonight, taking the Lightning Rod build every game just to get used to the new changes. Two things leapt out at me, one being a bug and the other being a prospective balance issue:

1. His new level 1 talent, Dishonorable Discharge, states ""After 3 Lightning Rod strikes, subsequent strikes on enemy Heroes increases its damage by 1%, up to 75%."" However, this quest completes on ***all*** targets. minions, mercenaries, structures, bosses, monsters, summons. It makes it ludicrously easy to stack to completion. Which brings me to;
2. The double damage that Lightning Rod deals to minions and mercenaries (in exchange for bribe going away) sounded like a great idea except that it works on bosses. Falstad can solo any boss in the game (as far as I can tell) after 13 with a completed level 1 quest. And he can do it ***very very*** quickly. We're talking original Hanzo scatter-arrow build levels of speed, but because Falstad can build to constantly shield himself, he can do it with relatively little risk by comparison (adding on that Gust allows him to make sure very few people can steal the boss)

You can take just about any boss in the time it takes to fully cast two Lightning Rods, so around 30 seconds."

heroesofthestorm,Proposed Malthael Rework,"Bruisers are an interesting pick in many comps bridging the gap between assassin and tank with some being more “tanky” such as Dehaka and other being more for damage like Malthael who in my opinion needs a rework. This is not in terms of his viability as I have great success with him most games and especially with the current tank meta we are in now. The issue is his build variety and how for the most part he ends up playing one build with many talents not being picked. So here is my proposed rework. 

Trait: Reaper’s Mark 
Additional Functionality: Auto-Attacks deal 5% of target's missing health as damage vs marked targets.

Level 1:

On a Pale Horse: Untouched
Fear the Reaper: Function Changed: Activate to instantly teleport behind a marked hero within range. Cooldown: 30 seconds.
Death’s Reach: Moved to level 4.
Transient Spectre: New Talent: Passive: Increase your movement speed by 10% and you can move through other units.

Level 4:

Death’s Reach: Moved from level 1.
Throwing Shade: Untouched.
Die Alone: Removed.
Soul Feast: New Talent: Soul Rip deals 2% of the targets max health as bonus damage. Bonus healing is increased to 4.75% of enemy heroes maximum health.

Level 7:

Cold Hand: Buffed to 30%.
Massacre: Additional Functionality: Deals 50% additional damage.
Final Curtain: Moved from level 20. Additional Functionality: Deals 8% Maximum Health as damage over its duration to enemy heroes in its area of effect. This is increased to 16% Maximum Health vs enemy minions, summons and mercs.

Level 10:

Tormented Souls: No longer resets Wraith Strike. New Functionality: While active, Soul Rip's Cooldown is set to 0.75 seconds.
Last Rights: Reworked: Deal 400 (+4% per level) damage after 2 seconds. Wraith Strike deals 100% more damage vs the target and for 1 second after. Quest remains the same.

Level 13:

Soul Siphon: Reworked: Gain 2 armor for every enemy hit by Soul Rip. Up to maximum of 30. Lasts 2 seconds.
Ethereal Existence: Reworked: Casting Wraith Strike causes the next 2 enemy basic attacks to miss.
Inevitable End: Untouched.
Shroud of Wisdom: Reworked: Casting Death Shroud grants Malthael 40 Spell Armor for 2 seconds. Hitting enemies refreshes the duration.

Level 16:

Soul Collector: Untouched.
Mortality: Reworked: Deals an extra 10% of targets missing health as damage.
Memento Mori: Buffed to 110% additional damage.
Death's Embrace: Increase the width of Death Shroud by 200%. Enemies hit have their armor reduced by 10 for 5 seconds.

Level 20:

Reaper of Souls: Additional Functionality: While active Soul Rip deals 50% more damage.
Angel of Death: Reworked: No longer heals. Damage increased by 30%. Cooldown reduction bonuses doubled just the same.
No One Can Stop Death: Untouched.
Grim Reaper: New Talent: Passive: The bonus damage your auto-attacks deal is increased to 15% of the target's missing health.


Notes: With these changes Q build becomes the bruiser and anti-high health build. Effective in sustained team fights vs grouped up enemies. 
The W build is now a lot more viable and is suitable vs teams that have more squishy ranged heroes and makes Malthael more of a backline assassin. 
Finally the E build can now be a thing, being focused on clearing waves and killing PVE targets quickly.

Tormented Souls obviously needed some big changes but rather than just return its old armor, I felt that it could be viable when selected along side Q talents which makes sense as Q builds are designed for sustained group fights anyway.

On the flip side and perhaps most controversial was my decision to rework Last Rights. As it stands, it's pretty much the go to ultimate and sometimes Malthael is picked for this ultimate alone. This is a problem in my opinion as I don't feel any hero should be picked mostly due to their ultimates. 
After much thought, I came up with the idea that if Tormented Souls would be the Bruiser and anti-health sustained ultimate, then Last Rights should be the burst ultimate; which it currently is but only in execute scenarios. The above change gives it immediate burst instead and (with the additional Wraith Strike bonus damage) can lead to nice combos, giving it a much more assassin type feel.

I did not throw away the whole missing health idea away however and instead split it up between his auto attacks and Mortality at level 16. Giving the mechanic a place in Malthael's base kit and trait as opposed to a single ability.

The goal was to spice him up and give him dedicated builds that serve a variety of situations depending on the comp and map.

Appreciate your thoughts. Cheers :)"

The amount of ranked games we’ve started off losing, I get flamed ,then I hit my spike and we win is astonishing. If you have a K’T on your team be graceful with them until they hit their blight count. Unless they’re missing all their abilities.

heroesofthestorm,"Tyrael's Death Timer reduction is triggering on non-Heroes, so if he explodes on 10 Minions or Infernal Shrines monsters he has 0 Death Timer","This happens because they added the following trigger to TyraelData.xml (2nd line below) which means when Tyrael deals damage to a unit of any kind with his Trait explosion it directly bypasses the usual validator for the target being a Hero and reduces his death timer by 10%. Since the Death Timer reduction already had a cap of 10 Heroes, and it now triggers on non-Heroes, he can have 0 Death Timer by hitting at least 10 targets, at any point in the game.

He can also quite easily get 70% Death Timer reduction by simply hitting a Minion Wave.

heroesofthestorm,HotS Community NEEDS some communication from the Devs,"Hey everyone,

===

Disclaimed Edit: I realized a lot of people thought this to be a ""DAED GAEM NAO"" or similar pessimistic/hate post. I'm not native and I may not have expressed myself the best. I'm not going to edit the post but please try to read with a more curious and asking tone rather than decisive and demanding. Also devs, ILY.

===

Playing since Alpha, took a break and came back with 2.0, never stopped. HotS is one of my favorite games ever and possibly the fav Blizz game. I've been an advocate of the game from the start, still am. I love the devs, love the designs, love everything.

A couple of years ago, I even DM'd a silly Nexus campaign with characters such as Butcher the Butcher; Marquis Arthas, the obvious vampire that never accepts it; the nefarious, adorable, inseparable trio of Stitches, Brightwing and Abathur etc.

I've also had the pleasure of interviewing Kaeo (and another dev whose name I can't recall now - sorry!) in Gamescom and ask them a question in the panel on 2019 BlizzCon.

Finally, I am sort of a pro-player too, which means I choose Carbot portraits only (that's how it works, right?)

Anyway, when the team reduction was announced, I was disappointed as everyone but I wasn't directly pessimistic. Honestly, I think I was equally sad for devs who had to stop working on this project - I'm sure many loved it (\*looks at the sky, sends a kiss with two fingers, whispering ""Kevin""\*)

And honestly, while I won't say no to more heroes, I've been happy with the direction overall. The reworks, the Anomalies (sure, not all landed well but they weren't forced on us permanently), the crazy Deathwing... They've also communicated quite often.

In this process, many have left. Understandable, especially those who followed the esports part mostly or those who were part of it and felt almost betrayed. But some of us stayed, some joined and the community even started its own esports action.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's been strange lately.

* Hopefully, I've simply missed them, but to my knowledge, we haven't had an AMA for a while.
* There are plausible rumours about the team being discarded and/or moved to other projects.
* There are rumours about VV taking over.
* We know at least some devs moved (like AZJackson - who announced on twitter. for those who missed it, an anonymous replacement was also announced)
* HotS was not represented in BlizzConline at all. Like, not even one panel talking about the last year or something.

The only other game without a full panel was Starcraft II, which is now on actual maintenance mode (which is fair, after so many years of support).

&amp;#x200B;

And my fellow Nexians, this is the first time I'm actually concerned about the future of the game. I thought of a few situations (listed from worst to best):

A- WORST CASE SCENARIO - FULL MAINTENANCE MODE: HotS is going to go into maintenance mode. We may see some tech support but that's all. That's why they didn't want to have a panel - there is nothing to say about the future except false hope.

B- ALMOST MAINTENANCE MODE: Same as above, except we occasionally get some minor balance updates. Same as above about the panel.

C- SMALLER TEAM: The team has been shrunk further and we'll have the status quo ongoing, except even slower, meaning we'll see some reworks every 2/3 months and maybe a new hero every 6-10 months. They didn't want to have a panel because 1) HotS is not important anymore and 2) Devs can't spare ANY time.

D- NEW, SMALL TEAM: Same as above except the team is now being handed to VV and while some seniors might currently be there for a handover, they won't stay. So for the panel, in addition to above 3) With the transition, they couldn't spare time for a panel

E- NEW TEAM: Team hasn't necessarily shrunk but the game is being handed to VV. So, due the transition they didn't have time, plus they are possibly deciding the new strategy and want to communicate later.

F- BEST CASE SCENARIO: (SLIGHTLY) LARGER TEAM: Some team members might be moved around but others have joined from inside Blizz, new hires and VV. Same as above - they've been busy with the transition, they want to finalize their strategy before they communicate with us.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to be honest, I'm not very optimistic because since the game was reduced due to a corporate decision, I expect that HotS needs to make money and it's not exactly a money-maker. I mean as a player, I love being able to access anything but as someone who worked in free-2-play sales, I've always been confused about how the game almost feels like it DOESN'T want me to pay. And with less skins, less heroes etc, many of us older players have literally nothing to spend even the shards on.

I've personally had terrible corporate decisions to deal with, so I'm not so optimistic. But then again - maybe the expectations were set with all that in perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.

I think what matters is the truth and we need to hear from the devs. Obviously, they can't share everything but there are many questions we need answers to. From the top of my head:

1. What should we expect in terms of release cycles from now on?
2. Has the team changed, can you tell us more about it?
3. What is the speed of an unladen swallow?
4. What's your stance on community esports and future official esports, even at smaller rate?
5. Are we getting Blackthorne?

&amp;#x200B;

Or other questions. I don't mind in what shape or form it is, but as a dedicated, loyal fan of many years, I really hope to hear from the team and personally, I'd really like to hear the answers to questions 1-3.

Am I the only one who's concerned? Have I been missing communications? Give me some hope, Nexians!"
heroesofthestorm,Why was Falstad's gathering storm hit so hard with the nerf bat?,"I mean, I thought the talent was already meme tier, but at least it was fun in ARAM. Now though. It is so bad I cannot conceivably understand why they made it so unimaginably bad. Every 5 hits is now 1% damage where before it would have been 10 extra damage. At level 1, your hammer hits for 83 damage. Hitting 10 heroes gives 2% damage.... for a grand total of 1.66 extra damage where it used to be 20 extra damage. 

But, but, the % damage scales with the base power of the ability. Sure it does but at level 20, it STILL Sucks. Lets say you are still only hit 10 times by level 20 (for 20 extra damage). Level 20 Hammerang is hitting for 175 damage... so 2% more damage is a whole 3.5 damage. It will never be any better. It just can't be. The only argument is that it buffs the new baseline reactivation explosion, but even then, the explosion + 1 hit of the hammer is still going to be less than the old hammer hitting with the bonus damage and explosion. I mean they recently buffed the damage from 1.5 to 2.0, so it just boggles the mine that the basically make the talent worthless (and nerfed its mana gain as well).  So dumb, and then they make the auto attack damage quest better. Might as well remove the gathering storm talent so it isn't a noob trap.

/end rant."

heroesofthestorm,The recent patches made the game start so slow. Why does it take 2-3 minutes before it even starts?,"This is a 100% technical problem.

The whole idea of waiting the game to start for so long (+the queue later) is just sad"
heroesofthestorm,How falstad and tyrael changes do not align with the concept of the heroes.,"First of all I want to say last night patch was pretty good, lots of good and fun changes, other than usual bugs that are starting to be the same on each patch. Despite all that two heroes (falstad and tyrael) do not recieved changes that actually match the way the hero is played:

&amp;#x200B;

# Falstad:

&amp;#x200B;

Before patch we would recognize to build paths: Autoattack build (seasoned marksman, boomerang, giant killer); wingman trait build (wingman, boomerang, trait talents); and cassually for some W build.  


This builds have one thing in common that align with the hero concept: Falstad is a global, he wants to create map pressure, and his lvl one talents will stack from this to create value. You are rewarded into your stats for your play, not just xp and buildings.

Now with the changes Falstad went from having 2 talents that stack with minions to one, but he is a global, doesn't he want to pve most of the game? naturally there is only one viable choice. But what if I don't play global, I get my stacks and play the game? Ok, fine, but why you didin't picked Cassia then?  This patch actually killed (in theory) build diversity, and is not noticeable thanks to the fact that the new lvl 1 W talent is bugged and DOES stack of pve targets.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tyrael:

Lots of cool stuff (and cool bugs), but there is one change I completely hate and it just doesn't make sense.  


 

* No longer increases El’Druin’s Might’s Slow.
* Additional functionality: Every enemy Hero hit by El’Druin’s Might heals Tyrael for 3% of his maximum Health.

Just why? this has been the strongest talent of the tier for tyrael since the end of hgc, It enables more efficient plays and control for and with his team, was it over power? if so may be I could understand it. If the heal component is understood as a buff, is completely wrong, he doesn't need more tankiness (else people wouldn't pick justice for all and bound by law before), due to his mobility and nature of the kit. The nerf of this talent alone feels like a straight up nerf to the hero.

**bring bound by law back**"
heroesofthestorm,"New patch spoilers thread, since still no patch notes.","The new patch may not work, but CASCExtract still does on it.

I'll start with a teaser. Chromie Slowing Sands cast range was nerfed to 8, from 10 previously."
heroesofthestorm,Li Li's Wind Serpent movement speed bonus stacks with its trait speed bonus?,Can it reach +30% movement speed bonus?
heroesofthestorm,Blizzard and Falstad - Gathering Storm,"Love the baseline Q changes but wow did they not test the Gathering Storm changes? It was already the weakest talent at it's tier but now it's even worse. 

You need to hit someone 5 times to get 1 damage! Even doubling to 0.4% damage per stack is really bad. You'd need 500 stacks to hit 50% bonus damage on his Q and at level 20 that's adding only 87.5 damage. 

I hope this receives a major buff next patch.

Edit: at 500 stacks the damage bonus would be 100% so 175 damage on Q at 20 with 500 stacks."
heroesofthestorm,New patch 2.53.2.84200 is live on NA,^
heroesofthestorm,What were the changes to Tracer this patch?,Didn't see anything in the patch notes but I heard she got some buffs.
heroesofthestorm,Chromie Nerf Idea,"The recent patch lowered her damage output a bit, but I’d take a different approach. I think the game should reward players who plan ahead (how on theme for the character) and who risk positioning her closer to the action. 

The change is simple — just make it so Time Trap has almost no cast range and Slowing Sands is a 1 second channel that spawns ON Chromie.

Thoughts?"
heroesofthestorm,Scarlet Wrath is still unpickable for one reason.,"Scarlet Wrath amplifies Spell Damage, and only Spell Damage, in a build where AA damage accounts for a majority of total damage, while making AA's more risky to perform. Meanwhile Lashing Out enables 100% Uptime on the AA steroid with good aim.

The raw DPS of AA's becomes superior over a Fanatical Power Inquisition at 3 Zeals, while taking Scarlet Wrath over Lashing Out means less damage from Saintly Greatstaff due to both being unable to pop it during Inquisition and simply having less Searing Lashes to set it over the same timespan.

Scarlet Wrath as it stands right now would be objectively stronger if put on Whitemane's level 16 tier, while moving Harsh Discipline to 13. Harsh Discipline is capable of competing on the 13 tier far better than Scarlet Wrath, while Scarlet Wrath at 16 gives an AA build talent to a tier that does not have one. Radiance is anti-burst in every build."
heroesofthestorm,The descriptions are still incorrect,"**I'm...really dissapointed, Blizz. Is that so hard to not use Google translator?**

I'm glad that you fixed the second part...but it still doesn't have ""**!Quest**"" and the description still says this talent increases Loothoard's RADIUS, not its cast RANGE. These are different things actually. Oh and Hogger still doesn't say anything when you start queue or ""spin-stun"" him.

&amp;#x200B;

And...**Morenados!** is still not fixed too:

[Morenados!, Deckard's Lorenado buff](https://preview.redd.it/squhrgt9wpk61.png?width=356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e652b82e573d528ee54ab60ed1d8b772ac36c5d)

Yep, it stills says that Lorenado gains an additional charge **EACH TIME it hits a hero...** and it's a wrong description.

&amp;#x200B;

**And i also found this:**

[ Dance of Death, Samuro's Bladestorm buff](https://preview.redd.it/1orat6xbwpk61.png?width=354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9142f1d7c794424ff5c2ae11194b89f3a0e2260)

I didn't know enemies can have 20 heroes on their side in a single game.

And the funniest thing:

Am i the only one who thinks this is the wrong description?

Isn't this supposed to be:

**Mirror Images use Bladestorm when Samuro does, but for 45%. After Samuro hits enemy Heroes 20 times with Bladestorm, its cooldown is reset.**

And:

**Зеркальные копии повторяют «Вихрь клинков» за Самуро, нанося 45% его урона. После того как «Вихрь клинков» поражает героев 20 раз, он восстанавливается мгновенно.**

Now...this:

[Mephisto's Q, Skull Missile](https://preview.redd.it/1y50p3op6qk61.png?width=241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cae3eeed607ead697b5b792046b119b614bf932)

**1 second cooldown?** Are you sure???

You missed ""SPACE"" between ""40%"" and ""больше""...this is pretty dumb.

Now this...

You forgot to type that Diablo will instantly heal 2.5% of his max. health after stunning an enemy Hero with Shadow Charge or Overpower...somehow.

This one...

https://preview.redd.it/3r2ac702mrk61.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c43fd6e92855fc869ed36720dc537ef8e1b364

Are you SERIOUS? **УменьшААет?** Then why not **Reeduce** instead of Reduce?

Oh and by the way, killing whom?

Why is it ""**Убийства восстанавливают его мгновенно.**"" and not ""**Убийства героев восстанавливают его мгновенно.**""

While in ENG it says about ""Takedowns"" which mean heroes, not every enemy. There is a REALLY big difference between these two.

Yes, i know that it's hard for you team to keep the game...but is it so hard to at least not fail the descriptions?"

heroesofthestorm,How to get out of bronze 5,"Hi there, I’m new to hots storm league (and mobas entirely) and yeah I’m not great. I’ve been stuck in bronze 5 for a month now and I have no clue how to get out. For every one match I win, I lose 3. I don’t want to be one of those, “everyone on my team sucks but me” people, but it genuinely feels like this rank in impossible to escape. The teams are just crazy though, tilted people throwing, people refusing to do objectives, people rushing into team fights solo, etc. just really bad macro plays in general.

Is there anything I can do individually to try and get out of this? I’ve had matches where I play like crap and die 7 times, then a match where I have great stats. The problem is I gain and lose the same number of points. 

I don’t really have friends to play with, unfortunately, they’re all levels ahead of me (and honestly I’m not good enough and would just bring their level down and I don’t want that).

I don’t mind being in bronze, I’m not a skilled player, I just want to get out of bronze 5 and I’m not sure how. Any advice?"

   * Max HP improvement reduced from 100% to 50%.
   * Respawn time reduced from 16s to 12s

**Level 20**

* **New Talent:** The Salmon Run
   * Respawn time reduced by 2 seconds.

\---------

The focus of these changes is to get rid of that bribe talent. It encourages the wrong kind of gameplay. Instead we want Murky to take more risks regarding egg placement. However, we don't want to lose the part of playing as and dealing with Murky that requires the other team to be conscious about preventing stacks. That's why both egg talents require Murky to have an active role in the lane.

Fish Eye makes the Egg easy to track. Although we want this to enable egg killing strats, ambush strats are too much here. The protected status will allow Murky to avoid these sort of ambushes unless they are cc heavy. Thus making Fish Eye less of a liability.

A watered-down Big Tuna Kahuna is available at level 13. To give Murky a fighting chance against high-burst heroes

Time to Krill was an undeperforming talent , but this will make it also useful against Bosses and Objective rewards.

Egg Shell was by all measures a trap talent, and BTK at level 13 will cover its niche of dealing with high burst teams by sacrificing Rejuvenating Bubble or Fish Tank.

Salmon Run at 20 will bring upon the return of insesantly respawning Murky, even though the timer will still be longer than pre-rework timer, but keep in mind that you have to sacrifice the other level 20 talents to get to enjoying.

heroesofthestorm,Help climbing back to Diamond from Gold,"Hey guys;

I've been playing HOTS on and off for about 4 years. On the first seasons, I was able to consistently stay in Diamond; never dropped to Platinum, but never was able to come closer to being promoted to Masters.


But, slowly but surely, I've been consistently dropping from the ranks; first to high-platinum, then mid-platinum, now I'm barely being able to come out from Gold and, when I do, I lose a few matches in a row and demote back to Gold.


Is someone available to watch some replays and give some tips? I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong; I feel that I'm doing OK mechanically speaking, and I feel that my team is ALWAYS having huge problems that makes it almost impossible to win, like players disconnecting from the start of the game and never coming back, or the last pick chosing a ranged DPS when we don't have a healer; obviously, we just get rolfstomped both because the technical disavantage (eg lack of healer or an afk player) and due the rest of the team arguing over the problem. Recently I had someone picking up the Dragon on Dragon Shire and then insta-abandon it, just for the spite of it.


I mainly play ranged DPS (Kaelthas, Tychus, Valla, Nazeebo), and can fill the healer (Lili) and Bruiser (Xul, Malthael) when needed. My tank skills are definitely bad, so I never play it on Ranked.


I've uploaded 5 games that I've lost on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10I4cTMgYzTdt2O8Rg4hl8BP75IH34eca/view?usp=sharing

heroesofthestorm,"New player, which healer to main?","So far my favorite heroes overall are Artanis, Guldan, Malfurion and Stukov. Are Stukov and Malfurion a reasonable healer for a new player to try out, or would you consider the skill ceiling too high ? Brightwing is pretty fun too, but I like having a mount, as stupid as that sounds. Outside of maybe 30 AI games I have 0 MOBA experience."
heroesofthestorm,Weird interaction with Hogger on Alterac Pass,"You can block the boss' way to the core with your loots and actually force the boss to move mid lane to attack the core.

Maybe they couldn't end because there were two keeps up, but the core's health was 7184 when the attack finally ended and could go back to heal up.

The game went on for an additional 8 minutes (up to 30 mins max), when the blue team couldnt capture obj (1.5 sec left), and the red team got obj and pushed down their core.

heroesofthestorm,Stukov 10 and 20 Talent,"I'm trying out Stukov and am just using the most played/highest win % build on hotslogs. My question is how do I use his Flailing Swipe? Just to make space when things get dicey? Is it really that much better than shove? Also, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but on hotslogs it doesn't show any of the level 20 talents on the builds, so I just went for the heroic buff. Currently I'm just healing/spreading as often as I can, using his weighted pustules when I have a safe opportunity, lurking arm to try to zone, and popping the trait for burst healing when there's lots of damage going out in team fights.

heroesofthestorm,Being a TANK will make you a better DPS,"Being a TANK will make you a better DPS.

This is something die-hard assassin mains NEED to understand. Heroes is a very team based game, as we all know, so IDEALY the best situation would be one person controlling every character. Everyone is on the same page and understands what's going on etc.

Obviously this can't happen but the closer we get to that the better. And what I see a lot is that people who suck at tank usually suck at assassin as well and here's why.

You don't know what a good engage looks like before it happens. You don't see the ""symptoms"" of a good engage. So you play too safe.

From a heavy tank player here's what I can tell you. Generally it looks like this. Let's say I am ETC in this example. As a tank I'm checking for the cool downs of the enemy team, (which ones am I worried about) I'm looking at positioning, if they are clumping or bottle necked which would lead to a good stun, and MOST importantly is my damage in a position to DO anything if I engage. There's no point in me using my CC if nothing happens after. And SO often I see the Valla or sylvanas or whoever sitting back SO far waiting for a stun that CAN'T happen unless they step up. 

As an assassin your positioning is one of the deciding factors if your tank can engage. And if you can't recognize if the other conditions are being met (enemy cool downs/positioning) then you will continue to make your tank have to engage at bad times or not at all. And this usually leads to the assassin flaming the tank for never stunning/rooting. 

Now all,of this comes down to game experience. You need to know the range and situations your tank wants to see. This means you need to play them. If you can put yourself in the tanks shoes you can ask ""what would muradin need to see from me in order to engage so that he knows that I see what he sees."" You need to posture and show that you understand you have a good engage here and you are stepping up ready to do that damage.

TLDR: you need to step up as an assassin to show your tank you see the enage before it happens."

This is a severe and critical problem in KR HOTS for every games including Storm League, A.I and Quick Match over 2 years.  
One certain group uses virtual window and macro program to make tons of clone accounts for abusing. Those clones just run to the mid lane without playing anything. Surprisingly, one of them even broadcasts this in Twitch for weeks. 

After making enough level of account, they abuses match making system to take the clones to higher tier. Even they act as a broker selling this system if they get an offer from a player who wants to make his account to Master tier. They put their ""customer"" with 4 clones and start searching when another party created with 5 clones at the same time.

Don't say it's just a matter in KR or CN server. If Blizzard doesn't have interest in this and don't prevent it, next target would be U.S and ER server.  
I know preventing every abusing is impossible, though, I sincerely wish ban using virtual WINDOW. It has made many players suffered and disrespected."
heroesofthestorm,How do you improve your own skill when matchmaking trivializes the outcome of the match?,"On a lot of posts that are about improving, climbing the ladder, or having a good mindset, the main takeaway is that you need to focus on your own mistakes, even when you can point out obvious mistakes by your team.

While this is certainly going to improve the things that you contribute to a match, at the end of the day if it doesn't mean you actually win more games, this ""improvement"" feels really lackluster. Not only are the other 4 players (who you can't influence more than with kind words and pings) a much bigger influence on the outcome of a match than your own skill, the matchmaking makes your own contribution even less significant.
4-stacks vs solo players, a diamond player with their gold buddy, 90+% winrate smurfs - even though in some matches your own improvement might win a game, most of the time it's simply not enough.

What is your take on this topic? Is there some trick to be satisfied with your own improvement regardless of the outcome of the match?"

# Heroes Profile Uploader v2.0.1- [Github Repo](https://github.com/Heroes-Profile/HeroesProfile.Uploader)

The release of v2.0.0 went live last week followed shortly by v2.0.1 to fix some bugs.  This update included some efficiency updates along with the below content changes.  The items below are optional items that must be turned on or off.  Note:  If you play ARAM and get Industrial District, it is going to cause the uploader to potentially skip Prematch/Postmatch/Twitch Extension due to that map not creating a replay.

* Prematch has been turned back on.  Prematch allows you to see a summary of the players in the game before the game starts.  If you are in draft mode, this would occur after draft.
* Postmatch has been added.  If turned on, after your match ends, the uploader will open up a page to the Match/Single page on Heroes Profile
* Twitch Extension.  See section below about Heroes Profile Live.  This is for setting that tool up.

Major Bug/Issues Resolved

* Fixed issue where AI games showed incomplete on UI - [Github Issue](https://github.com/Heroes-Profile/HeroesProfile.Uploader/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
* Changed upload order.  Now it uploads from oldest to newest, while keeping visualization of newest to oldest.  Important for MMR calculations - [Github Issue](https://github.com/Heroes-Profile/HeroesProfile.Uploader/issues/3)
* Pass more data out of upload.  For use with Postmatch - [Github Issue](https://github.com/Heroes-Profile/HeroesProfile.Uploader/issues/2)

# Heroes Profile Live

We are going to be deploying a new tool within the next week (assuming we can get past the strict twitch review process 😡).  We call it Heroes Profile Live.  It is an integration between the Heroes Profile Uploader, and Twitch.  If a streamer has the Heroes Profile Live extension installed on their Twitch Channel, and the Heroes Profile Uploader installed and configured on their computer, then viewers of the stream can interact with a panel on the streamers stream to see what talents have been chosen during the game for each player in that game.  Note:  Due to the way the temporary game files work with HoTs, there can be a slight delay between when talents are chosen in-game, and when they visualize on the extension.

You can see our documentation on setting that up at [https://api.heroesprofile.com/docs/1.0/Twitch/Extension/Usage](https://api.heroesprofile.com/docs/1.0/Twitch/Extension/Usage).  If you scroll to the bottom you can see some in-use screenshots.  Note.  Step 5 cannot be completed until Twitch finalizes their review.  


We will be making another post when we are fully live with the tool.

&amp;#x200B;

# Replay Downloads

We have added the ability for users to download replays directly off the Match/Single page of the site. ([https://www.heroesprofile.com/Match/Single/?replayID=35110588](https://www.heroesprofile.com/Match/Single/?replayID=35110588) for example).  There is now a ""Download Replay"" button under the general info about the replay.  If no button exists, the raw replay file has been deleted, or it exists at the HotsAPI storage. (Looking to resolve this)

Note:  We have limited the amount of replays a user can download.  It costs us money to pull these down, so we are starting small to see how it affects overall costs.  


We have also added this functionality to the API site. You can see some documentation on it at [https://api.heroesprofile.com/docs/1.0/Replay/Download](https://api.heroesprofile.com/docs/1.0/Replay/Download)

&amp;#x200B;

# Minor Site Changes

Some of these changes have been around for awhile, before Q1

* Increased number of builds visible from 5 to 7 on Global Hero and Global Hero Talents pages.
* Added more caching across the site to speed up pages
* Revamped the Amateur Series pages into Community ESports
* Added CCL to the site.
* Bug fixes here and there

We are testing out adding Game Data information to the website.  We have a development version of that at [https://dev.heroesprofile.com/](https://dev.heroesprofile.com/).  Please let us know what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

# Gift Box

We are currently providing Heroes Profile gift boxes for Patreons who have donated a total of $200 to the site.  We made a post on Patreon about that.  See that here [https://www.patreon.com/posts/47912136](https://www.patreon.com/posts/47912136)

Included in that are

* (1) Heroes Profile branded sweatshirt

Otherwise feel free to contact us at [contact@heroesprofile.com](mailto:contact@heroesprofile.com) and we can work out another option if you are interested and don't want to go through Patreon.

&amp;#x200B;

# Financials

  
We've done a lot of infrastructure changes, along with supporting different projects, so we took the time to re-evaluate our expenditures across the different platforms we use to support Heroes Profile.  During that evaluation we realized we are currently under accounting our costs.  Currently our running costs are nearing $500 a month, and our Patreon support is only at $311.  If you like the site and want to make sure it stays up and running, please consider donating.  Even $1 helps.  [https://www.patreon.com/heroesprofile](https://www.patreon.com/heroesprofile)

heroesofthestorm,The statistically most OP Talents/Builds by map in the game as of this patch (by web-scraping and analyzing Heroesprofile data),"**Edit**: This data is for Patch 2.53.1.83716

**For patch 2.53.2.84200, see this link (also with formatting improvements based on feedback): 
https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/lvgcp1/the_statistically_most_op_talentsbuilds_by_map_in/gpnqkkq/**

(Re-posting since I've significantly re-worked the analysis in response to some serious limitations in the original posting)

Individual Hero Winrates can be misleading because of pepegas taking bad Talents and dragging down the average performance on the Hero (e.g. Abathur Locust Build, Charizard Build Diablo, Black Hole Tassadar, Headhunter Zul'jin this patch). It's decent information for determining ban priority (along with Popularity) in the absence of specific targeted knowledge about your opponents, but on its own not the optimal information for determing Hero strength with best possible build, for what's OP that you can exploit for climbing.

Therefore, seeing that although it's easy to see the highest winrate Heroes on the online sites it's not easy to see not just the highest winrate Talent across all Heroes but also regressed toward the mean according for sample size, I made a simple scraping and analysis script in R that pulls this information.

I ranked, on the current game build and in Storm League across all ranks, &gt; baseline winrate (baseline is the average winrate of Talents by tier across all Heroes) Talents by lowest p-value with an exact binomial significance test of the difference. That is, Talents which are highly unlikely to be no better than chance, avoiding the problem of Talents only taken in a handful of games which happen to have unbelievably high Winrates.

This also accounts for the variance in the estimates of baseline winrates at each Tier; the level 20 Talent winrate baseline has the highest variance, since not all games reach lvl 20 for either Team (let alone both).

Baseline lvl 20 talent Winrate as of this writing is 60.5087% (that's the average winrate of all lvl 20 Talents, showing a significant percent of games where one team reaches lvl 20 end before the other team reaches 20, and of course very often in the first team's favor).

For lvl 16 it's 53.09802%, for lvl 13 it's 50.52292%, and for lvl 10 and lower it's extremely close to 50% (very rare for a game to end before both teams reach level 10, even on Braxis Holdout).

Note that although the ranking is by highest confidence of being better than baseline for that Tier (most proven game winning Talents) and these all have extremely high evidence of being strong, the exact ranking/differences from each other in most cases are not significant; these are all very strong Talents/Builds.

**tl;dr** Sonya W build OP is the most consistent, grossly OP on every map. But there are a lot of other finds here as well, with Recklessness Zul'jin being very strong, W build Uther, Rexxar Q build, Lucio Up the Frequency, Mura, Anub beetle build, Cassia, etc. having extraordinarily high winrate Talent options.

heroesofthestorm,"If you want to manage your own esports team, Teamfight Manager came out on steam yesterday","Its more a battle royale than a moba, but its still pretty fun.  If you liked the drafting and teambuilding strategy of esports as much as the action, its worth a look.  The drafting AI is excellent.  They will reliably grab the last tank to deny it to you, even if they have to run with 2 tanks.  And that's a draft loss every time.

Khaz and genji are both in game.

I am on no way affiliated with the devs."
heroesofthestorm,Have to get this off my chest...Tracer solo laners are not very smart,"Had this happen today...Tracer decides she's going to solo lane for 70% of the game, got so bad I gave them a tiny bit of shade about it...but they had middle ground damage and nothing else, contributed nothing to the team fights despite being hatted by Abby...

I am sorry but these are the kind of players who need to get reported because it's worse than non-participation. If you want to solo lane, pick someone who can do it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're learning Tracer, vs AI, test map or custom games is your best bet because even QM doesn't deserve a Tracer so dumb they go off and solo lane with an abby hat.

Okay rant over"
heroesofthestorm,What if ARAM had an AI option?,"ARAM is such a cool way to play. I also like that it teaches you the hero pool by force-picking an option trio. Sometimes my kids like to play ARAM with my and they’re up and coming novices.

heroesofthestorm,Heroes of the Storm Fandom Wiki,"Are there any similar website with as much details about the game mechanics? I use heroesofthestorm.fandom.com for a lot of information (for example I could actually learn alot from it about how Valla's Strafe actually works. I.e. Only hits 3 closest enemies prioritising heroes and only hits them a maximum of 11 times during the duration regardless of whether you are in range of 1 hero or 3 as well as more information. And its lvl20 upgrade only affects the first 3 out of 4 seconds of the ult)

But I was looking for information about the Braxis Zerg wave and even that website doesn't have the hp/dmg/scaling of each type of zergs. Don't know if I could find it anywhere outside of making a custom game and writing it out from there (already started but it takes longer than looking it up somewhere).

Also, how are things updated? I was looking at the hp/scaling of summons of Naz/Probius/Azmo/Zag and a few were off by a bit between calculating them from the base hp and scaling and matching them in try mode (my calculations aren't wrong, same calc used, sometimes they match, sometimes they don't). Is it from past datamining that hasn't been updated with new patches? I don't know how this kind of website works tbh."

heroesofthestorm,West coast players are put on Central US server.,"I am connecting from San Francisco. With Western US server, I get 35ms ping, which is great. WIth Central US server, I get 68ms ping, which is bad, and affects my gameplay. And I this is driving me away from the game.

Can someone please help me understand, why is a clearly west coast player, gets put onto Central US server when solo queueing? Sometimes when I play with Seattle friends, I get put back on Western US server, but this is only when we play together.

Please don't tell me your ping is way worse so I should feel better. As you reach a certain level in hots, 68ms is just not good enough, and it's very noticeable.

Anyone other west coast players notice similar problems? You can use ctrl+Alt+F in game to detect what server you are connected to."

heroesofthestorm,Might as well not show opponent premades AFTER the match either,"Because the ""not showing premades at the loading screen has been so successful, we should take it to the next level and not show premades after the match in the score screen. The whole purpose is to ""reduce toxicity and players becoming pissed"", and I've seen plenty of players get just as pissed during and after the match by seeing that premade grouping. Vicarious, this is how Team 1 did it, so live up to that example.

heroesofthestorm,Why I lost (no. 1),"So for every game i lose, i try to analyze why i lost. And what i could have done to turn it around.

I was thinking why not do it in a forum and see if i get other people’s opinions on how i can improve? I do not believe in hardstuck nonsense.

Nowadays, i usually play mei/muradin in storm league. I climbed from bronze to gold. Solo queue.

My team: muradin, greymane, liming, yrel, anduin

Enemy team: garrosh, uther, TLV, hanzo, chromie

Map: towers of doom

At the start, i knew that hanzo and chromie had better poke then mine. I also knew that muradin was better against garrosh because i might need to hug him to take the throw. Why be a ranged tank then? So i pick mura. 

Why we lost: my team got out poked. We could not dive their chromie or hanzo.

Yrel and tlv.. were kind of double soaking.

Partially to blame: greymane and li ming.. they should have poked garrosh harder as garrosh had lesser healing than mura. We had better sustain healing as anduin vs uther. Hard to dive the enemy backliners when they had easy stuns. Instead, they didnt aim garrosh hard. Trying for attacks on the backline.

Next, greymane didnt let yrel double soak. He soaked mid sometimes, then when he rotated bot he gets ganked. I told him to let yrel double soak and stick with us bot but he didnt listen. I could not guard both anduin/ liming bot and greymane mid vs a roaming garrosh. 


Bigger blame: me. Despite the above, i think this game was winnable. You see, i hugged gary when he wanted to throw. I did this. But i needed to do more if i wanted to climb. I saw that my team was being outpoked. Yet, I couldnt articulate it in game to aim garrosh. Only now i realized the problem.

Other mistakes of mine: i should have deviated from my normal build. I should not have taken the storm bolt quest at 1.  I should have taken third wind to outheal their poke even more. 

Even if we had less poke, our healing would have been way more. So net damage thru the poke trades could be won by ourside. From there, we can slowly crack garrosh as he dropped health and i stayed topped up. Once garrosh fell, My team would have an easy time.

Fighting 15v16. I went there because i felt that the team wasnt listening to my pings so far. So i thought they werent going to retreat.

Letting hanzo cap the tower when we were 7 hp making us drop to 3. I was thinking since team low health, i might need to tank fort. But no one else stopped hanzo from free cap. Guess it should have been my duty to stop the channel.


My mistakes: not taking third wind into heavy poke team. Not telling team to play poke wars into a team they cannot dive, fighting 15v16 (see reason), losing a free cap.

Feedback welcome.

heroesofthestorm,"Please tell me, whats new in the game?","I haven't played in four years what's new in the game, cant understand, why all heroes are free, what is about update 2.0, please tell me the most big news"
heroesofthestorm,Murky is too good sometimes,"I love playing Murky, but recently (this is purely anecdotal) there has been at least one Murky in every Quick Match game I've played, and the game always goes the same way: Murky pushes in the lanes, 1v1s like a champ, and can't be effectively punished by ganks or outplays. At level 1, Murky can push unattended lanes and accumulate Bribe stacks (it takes 3-4 waveclears to get enough stacks for a Giant/Turret Camp) After hitting level 4, Murky can safely keep two adjacent lanes pushed. After hitting 10, he can reliably execute low health pool heroes in 1v1. He is highly resistant to ganks due to his respawn mechanic. His push potential is so efficient that if all 9 other players go to the first objective and Murky stays in lane, he can reliably take a fort (which is worth more than the first objective basically all the time).

There are plenty of ways to counter the fish, but those are not present at low-MMR Quick Match. Teams don't coordinate with each other, comps are absolutely wild, and the result is that in these matches, Murky can reliably win games, with almost no regard for what the other 9 players in the game are doing. Playing against a Murky feels like an exercise in futility. This has been made worse because of the influx of new players to the game, a lot of accounts level less than 100 don't even know how to kill the Puffer Grenade, and I suspect Murky mains have noticed. Every QM I've played over the past few days (Literally) has had a Murky player in it, and they win a hugely disproportinate number of those games. I'm now at the point as a player where I spend my playtime losing against Murky, until I get salty and switch to Murky, and then effortlessly win low-quality games. 

I really love the hero, but I think it needs a nerf and I hope it gets one in the next patch."
heroesofthestorm,"Blizzard, here's one more customer done with you","I have a serious beef with you, Blizzard.   


How in the actual hell does someone insult **ME**, sling racial slurs, tell me to kill myself and then when i fire back *i get my account suspended?*  


This is the third time this shit has happened. So here's the deal: Since my money isn't good and only the feelings of butthurt little children matter, you'll get none of the latter and you can keep the former. Hey, they probably make you more money anyway.

heroesofthestorm,Low Performance Troubleshooting Shooting Help,"Hi, I recently jumped back into hots and have been issues running the game smoothly. Up until this past year, I've gotten consistent performance between 40-60 fps on medium settings at 1600x900. Now, anytime team fights happen, it jumps wildly between 60 to the low teens and below even on the bare lowest settings. I'm kind of at a loss and would like some suggestions to throw at my computer, here are my specs:

Processor: core i5 2.0GHz, up to 3.0GHz turbo, 6MB

Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M (2GB GDDR5)

Memory: 4GB DDR3 (1600Mhz)"
heroesofthestorm,I'm currently in bronze league and it seems like camps and soaking all lanes are often neglected and therefore it's possible to make a big difference by taking care of this,"I played a several games as healer or tank and tried to get team members to take care of camps or maximize xp soaking or defending lanes with attacking mercenaries before objectives etc.. basically the macro aspect of the game. Those things are too often ignored.

So instead of trying to argue, ping or chat about these things it sometimes worked quite well to concentrate on those things. Of course you need to pick a hero that is capable of those things in order to macro-carry a game."

Not really much else to say, anyone who's played with, as, or against a zuljin knows that he's completely fuckin op in ARAM. In general, stack characters should be removed from ARAM, but at the very least, this fucker needs to go."
heroesofthestorm,Question About Cast Radius,"Hi, I was playing hots with someone the other night, and they brought up a question that had me curious. They were wondering if you could cast ranged abilities from their immediate radius rather than the location of the cast.

For example, if I'm playing a ranged hero like kael'thas or jaina, whenever I cast flamestrike/blizzard whether via quickcast/quickcast off/on release, they move to the cast location until it's within the hero's radius. Was there a way for them to automatically activate it in the direction of the cast rather than moving to the location?"
heroesofthestorm,Rexxar's Bestial Wrath needs some love,"I think most Rexxar mains would agree that [[Bestial Wrath is]] almost never a better option than Boars 90% of the time. I think it should really provide either Unstoppable or large CC resistance (like Wrath of the Berserker for Sonya) or at least some form of passive benefit for Misha, such as bonus life, armor, or health regeneration. 

Maybe a larger stun area/lower cooldown on Charge during the 12 seconds?"

While I \*was\* able to cancel the vast majority, having this happen multiple times in the same game was frustrating, to say the least.

They ""E"" key itself works just fine, no issues with any other hero, no issue with typing it, no problems anywhere else except butcher cancellation. Is there a specific time window now where there wasn't maybe a year or so ago?"

heroesofthestorm,Is Hogger the worst hero ever created in HotS?,"I've played him a few times in ARAM and other than going the extremely boring bomb build he absolutely contributes nothing every single time I play him. This is coming from someone who mains bruisers and understand the basic fundamentals of a bruiser.

That said, Hogger seems to contribute very little if anything at all during a game. Can anyone explain to me how to actually play this hero?"
heroesofthestorm,I wrote a web scraper to get the best single Talents from heroesprofile,"Individual Hero winrates can be misleading because of pepegas taking bad Talents and bringing down the Hero's overall winrate (e.g. Abathur Locust Build, Charizard Build Diablo).

Therefore, seeing that although it's easy to see the highest winrate Heroes on the online sites it's not easy to see not just the highest winrate Talent across Heroes but that adjusted for sample size, I made a simple scraping script in R that pulls this information.

I ranked, on the current game build and in Storm League across all ranks, &gt;50% winrate Talents by lowest p-value with an exact binomial significance test of the difference vs. a 50% winrate. That is, Talents which are highly unlikely to be no better than chance, avoiding the problem of Talents only taken in a handful of games which happen to have unbelievably high Winrates.

Note that this has an inherent bias toward lvl 20 Talents, as not all games ever reach lvl 20 for either team, and especially a losing team, and higher talent tiers in general. To correct for this I would need to know the average winrate of teams reaching a given talent tier. If I knew that I could rank by p-value relative to the average for that tier, and therefore Talents could be compared across tiers as those that are especially strong relative to the average for that game state.

**Edit: Baseline lvl 20 talent winrate as of this writing is 60.5087%, working on modifications to correct for this at this tier**

Even still I think this is useful information, as picking a Hero and building toward a particular strong lategame Talent, then putting an emphasis on soaking and actually reaching that point of the game, is still a good strategy in general (at least on maps not named Braxis Holdout).

It also wouldn't be too hard to construct a separate list by Map.

I could also break this out into ""Talent Tiers,"" of Talents with overlapping 95% confidence intervals, or whatever confidence level makes sense (essentially indistinguishably strong from each other) and make a visual, potentially.

**Edit**: (corrected given above to p-value of difference vs. average at that tier) Anyway, results in crude form for now as R output:

Game started as a fresh concept, as ""salvation"" from years of frustration playing Dota 1, but has now run its course, becoming increasingly annoying, with today probably being the worst experience I had (so far). 

It is no surprise that the game has been abandoned by the developers and the company altogether, no matter how hard they try to fool us with a few balance patches every now and then. How simple QoL changes such as warning new players before trying niche heroes (Aba, Murky) hasn't been implemente is beyond me: Today I had to play with a lvl 1 Aba, lvl 50 account who has not been playing in 5 years (and even so he used to play with the AI, so no multiplayer experience either.)

The fact that 90% of players are main assassins despite this game being heavily reliant on teamwork and composition shows that the game was doomed almost from the start, and that the company failed time after time to come up with a solution, or that they simply gave up after a few tries. I know QM is supposed to be this play-with-whatever-hero-you-want mode, but the matchmaking is flawed in every aspect, and it is easy to guess which team will win in games with no healer, depending on which team has the most self-sustain.

Once again, I know I'm not coming with anything new to the playerbase, and most will probably downvote or ignore this post entirely, since it is just a simple rant from someone who grew increasingly frustrated and disappointed in this game. ""It is what it is"", as they say. The only solution is to find 4 other players to group with and with whom you may have fun no matter the outcome of the game. Unfortunately, the friends I made in this game have already left for LoL, ER:BS, or have abandoned the moba genre entirely.

Worst thing of it all is that I'll probably enter into the nexus again tomorrow. I am not having fun when I win, and I am getting angry when I lose, yet I automatically double-click the HotS icon whenever I have some free time. I just need for this game to shut down its servers already, and to free me from this gaming purgatory.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Sorry if this rant bothers those who still love the game, I was once bothered by this kinda posts too. I'm happy for those who are discovering it just now and those who still know how to have fun with this game."
heroesofthestorm,Replay graphic bug or dying gpu after all,"So this occasionally happens to me while watching replay files and using the fast forward or rewind button. Can't always replicate it and it doesn't seem to happen that often. But its the second/third time now in a few weeks and I'm starting to get slightly paranoid.

Could this be a bug or should I say farewell to my GPU (which isnt that old). Nothing comparable happens while being in a game itself.

heroesofthestorm,I would gladly trade Murky's bribe for slightly more hp or regeneration,"Murky's rework is a big failure and I am saying this as someone who was level 98 before the rework and is currently approaching level 200. 

Murky used to have an interesting tier 1. But nowadays any high level Murky player will agree that Bribe is mandatory. And don't get me wrong, I can certainly do cool things with the other talents and bring value to my team with them. But the reality is that picking those talents will always be a selfish move becauses I would be contributing far much more with just bribe.

And I would love to be able to use [[Fish Eye]] or [[Egg Hunt]]. They are great talents that encourage Murky to play in actual risky and interesting way as opposed to being a lane bot dedicated to stacking up.

But Murky is very vulnerable due to his low hp. A bursty or resilient hero can completely screw him up if played by an adept player. And thanks to respawn time nerf, a couple of deaths can put you really behind in regards to the value you can provide to the team and you can easily lose your egg.  And these issues are not currently a balance problem BECAUSE MURKY HAS THE BRIBE. If Murky received any positive tweak, he would get too punishing becauise of the bribe.

The bribe is the reason why we can't just have a slight hp buff or perhaps a rework for [[Egg Shell]] that allowed it to really counter high burst heroes. And I thinkt that most of the player base would agree that it is extremely annoying to deal with Murky's bribe talent. So how about a deal? Remove that bribe talent and give a slight hp or health regen buff to Murky. Nothing massive."
heroesofthestorm,"Concept - Mannoroth, The Flayer","&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Stupid, pitiful creature. I am the rage in your heart. I am the fury of your thoughts. I alone empowered you to bring chaos to this world, and by the endless void, you shall!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/n27atc4lrxj61.jpg?width=415&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ada974832623aae8d0d52b01ee700e73904f9e54)

*Mannoroth* *was the barbaric Annihilan leader of the pit lords when Kil'jaeden recruited them. After Archimonde took control, he recognized Mannoroth's value as a brutal, bloodthirsty fighter and made the pit lord his second-in-command. A favored lieutenant to his masters in the Burning Legion, Mannoroth gave his blood to Gul'dan to whip the original Horde into a blood frenzy before the culling of the Draenei and the first assault on Azeroth. The pact was ultimately what compelled Grom Hellscream to confront Mannoroth in what would come to be known as Demon Fall Canyon, a conflict that passed on into legend with the fading of their lives.*

Mannoroth is a formidable tank that is incredibly dangerous if you let him get close. He mitigates damage by taking damage, but is weak against line of sight attacks in the early game. Bruisers get demolished by Mannoroth when they don't have a chip healer on their team, and he causes all kinds of carnage in team fights—sometimes even when his own team dies.

heroesofthestorm,Tips for macro Falstad play style,"Hi everyone

My favourite character is Ragnaros with blast wave build, as he is able to shove lanes, double soak and still fight. However, I get sick of being melee against 4 ranged so I want to learn a ranged character in depth.

I've been looking at Falstad, as I think he offers what I'm looking for: macro power while still being able to contribute in fights. I was hoping to get some opinions on the best build to capitalise on double soaking while not afk pushing, as well as advanced playstyle tips. 

So far I've tried the following build:

1: [[Wingman]] 

4: [[Hammer Gains]] 

7: [[BOOMerang]] 

10: [[Mighty Gust]] 

13: [[Flow Rider]] 

16: [[Aerie Gusts]] 

20: [[Wind Tunnel]] 

Are there any considerations for other talents when wanting to focus on macro? Any special tips for making the most of Falstad? I found that the explosion on q combined with the fast cooldowns at lvl 13 was really good for shoving quickly.

Thanks very much"
heroesofthestorm,Nerf Recklessness Zuljin,"**Tldr**: Please change Zuljin's Recklessness so the extra stack progress is removed on death.

**Situation**: The latest patch notes had a buff to Recklessness (Zuljin level 1), so basic attacks can give ""an additional stack"" of his damage quest.  That shifted his quest progress from highly important to supremely important.  The new talent has better winrate and way more popularity than the others, and encourages less-fun gameplay by opponents.  Of course Zuljin has the highest winrate for ranged assassins.

**Avoidance:** The only way to prevent an enemy Zuljin from stacking is to minimize interacting with him. Don't fight him so he can't stack.  That can be described positively: *""You should avoid wasteful fights anyhow"".*  The problem is that **Zuljin changes the calculation for if a fight is beneficial**.  Suppose at the start of a match I see a chance to kill a red hero, without losing our own guys.  That sounds like a great opportunity- but if it also gives Zuljin time for 15 basic attacks then maybe I should sit back passively.

Depending on the timing of objectives and bosses, it can even be **a win for Zuljin to pick a fight and die, so long as he gets some stacks first**.  Feed for dings.

**Competition:** The other two talents at level 1 are situational.  Headhunter will only work if you get takedowns (which might never happen), and Boneslicer requires hitting a Q (and the hit hero not leaving range).  But the condition to activate Recklessness is easy to meet; if the enemy doesn't lower Zuljin's health, then he can push a button to do it himself.  Since Recklessness is the easiest talent to activate, it would make sense to have the smallest benefit.

**Suggestion**: The word ""reckless"" means taking a big risk of loss, but currently Zuljin doesn't suffer much if he screws up and is killed.  If the Recklessness talent was changed so that the bonus quest dings are removed when he dies, then players still have the potential to achieve ridiculous damage boosts, but the enemy also has an approach to counterplay with aggression, instead of being punished for approaching their opponents."

heroesofthestorm,Is it possible to enjoy this game if you are not in a 5 man stack with decent players?,"1) ARAM: no mathmaking you can get literally anyone and I assure you, it will be that chimpanzee level player 80% of the time.

3) Unranked: current wait time 500 minutes, please stay tuned.

4) SL: welcome to smurf land, especially now that every hero is free. If you missed the chimpanzee from ARAM you can meet his friend, bonobo, who will make sure that you cannot carry this match hard enough for his repeated throws. At the end of the day you will be MVP and he will be 1-15 but luckily both of you get the same amount of negative points so you can enjoy him in the next match too. He cannot be matched againts you cause enemy team is already full with the 5 stack smurf. Oh and do not forget leavers or ppl who insta pick murky. Such memories!

Where is the old solo ranked? I have the feeling that I always have to babysit I always have to explain I always have to carry out of my mind to have a chance of winning a game if I am not in a 5 man team. Zero chance of higher level plays, there is basically no game mode where I can play with comparable lvl people unless we are 5. And I noticed that many of my friends are not willing to play as 4 either given their experiences with the bonobo and chimpanzee.

heroesofthestorm,There's A Reason HOTS Was Ignored for BlizzCon,"This game is simply unfun.

The snowball effect in this game feels way more influential than in LoL. And it's an ironic position for me, because I played HOTS \~2 years ago and loved it; I thought it was far superior to playing LoL. But now, after playing LoL a lot and honing my skills there, and then coming back to this game -- WOOF.

At least in LoL there's a forfeit if things are going absolutely atrociously, but even more importantly it feels like if you play right you have the potential to turn a game around. Or maybe if you make a solid play and catch the other team off guard, you can get a few towers to put you back in it.

But in this game, I have yet to see the momentum shift from the winning team to the losing team. Once the momentum is there, it's over.

And the few games I've seen Samuro in... I mean is this a joke? I haven't seen a hero this powerful in LoL, just players who can wield certain heroes so effectively that it feels OP. But I legitimately believe that anyone who says ""he rewards a high skill cap""; no, you're lying to yourself. Every game he dominates, and it's not the player; it's the hero.

And this being the internet, I already know the kinds of comments that will be flung at me willy-nilly. That's fine, believe what you will; just shouting my 2 cents into the hate void that is the internet.

But if you take a moment and wonder why this game doesn't get any developer love, it's probably because people simply don't play it in the right numbers for Blizzard to care about it. And if that's the case, then the reason might very simply be: it's unfun.

I wish it was more fun, because I really use to enjoy it. But it just feels awful when I play it; and I don't have enough hours in the day to waste on trying to make it feel fun.

heroesofthestorm,Game freezes at the start when loading each ability's first cast,"At the start of the game, when each character appears for the first time in the middle of the map and we all start casting abilities for the first time, each move that each person does freezes the game for me like it's being loaded into RAM for the first time. After the first major engages and witnessing everyone's abilities, the game stops freezing, but during those early encounters or meeting heroes for the first time, its a really sluggish experience.

I never used to have this issue but I have for a while now, and I was wondering if everyone gets it and if anyone knows why I'm getting it?"
heroesofthestorm,Remove minimap clicking?,"I’ve looked all through the settings, can’t find a solution. Too often i accidentally click on the minimap and screw up a teamfight. Any way to disable it?"
heroesofthestorm,Do you play hots with 3 or 4 fingers?,"I play with 4 fingers and for a long time thought that was the standard but recently found out all my friends play with 3 fingers.

I made a strawpoll so you can vote your playstyle

http://www.strawpoll.me/42706814"
heroesofthestorm,Mount unavaible after purchase,"So  brought the angry and happy cloud mounts (seperatly) but i cant equip either of them in ranked play.

But they are unlocked in my collection and i can not buy them again. 

Other mounts that i bought since were unlocked as usual...

Any ideas or similiar problems?"

heroesofthestorm,Brightwing Gameplay &amp; Commentary,"This game highlights how I try to use Brightwing to phase and heal our way to victory.

Note, that I don't use Brightwing often and that's why I call this a commentary and not a guide.  I discuss my gameplay and chosen abilities but I definitely don't claim to be a pro BW player!  

Talents used in this game.   
1:  Hyper Shift.  
4:  Magic Spit.  
7:  Peekaboo!   
10: Blink Heal.  
13:  Safety Dust.

heroesofthestorm,Using a turret on Misha. Feel the real war bear!,"I just imagined what Misha would look like if one or two turrets could be placed on Misha. =D
Misha runs and at this time the turrets shoot at the enemies.
I hope this happens in the next possible rexar rework =)"
heroesofthestorm,Best Mei Tips,"Hey Heroes,

What are your best Mei tips for how to play her and the builds you use?

Post your answers below. :)"
heroesofthestorm,Probius not that bad in ARAM,"Is it just me or is Probius a underrated hero?.. (atleast in ARAM).

Have been lvling up the little protoss hero for some weeks now, and he is a hell of a fun character! Since he is rarely seen these days, most enemy players dont even know how to play vs him :D That is something I love taking advantage of :)

heroesofthestorm,Blizzard please stop matching Medivh against Abathur in QM,"It's a seriously unbalanced matchup. Abathur has all the advantage and my team has to suffer for it just because I picked Medivh. You might think ""both of these heroes provide shields so it's basically the same matchup"" but it's not. Abathur can solo push lanes, soak globally, pressure structures, hat anyone for an immediate 2v1 turnaround in a fight, heal players, heal structures, and Abathur's team mates don't even have to realize he's doing anything.

Medivh on the other hand has to Q the wave twice + auto each minion a few times to clear the wave, has to be next to any team mate that needs immediate help, has to properly time a shield so that his team mates get a measly heal, he can't heal structures, and his team mates have to actually click on portals so they can be saved.

Abathur needs to be matched with healers on both sides for proper matching or waveclear heroes like Xul. Pitting Medivh or Zarya vs Abathur is not balanced. I understand this was back during a time where ""supports"" used to be called ""specialists"" and so some changes were made in matchmaking to balance things out but those old matchmaking rules are antiquated and need to be updated."
heroesofthestorm,"All my settings (Talents, keybinds, and so on) are reset suddenly, help.","IDK why , but all my settings are reset, without me touching anything out of the ordinary.

Why did this happen, and what can I do to have them the same again, without having to put every single talent set and keybind as I had them manually?

Edit: They reset everytime I launch the game... :(

**Edit2, Solved: Windows defender was blocking it... And all my settings are back &lt;3**"

heroesofthestorm,As a longtime Blizzard fan i'm sad that Heroes has been let down and really hope they keep the longtime support or give it another try.,"I started with Warcraft II and played all three universes (no overwatch yet) a lot! That's one of the things I love about heroes, a little bit Starcraft, Warcraft and Diablo feeling from time to time. 

Also I played Dota a lot and it always felt a little wrong or at least sad to play Dota 2 (or other Mobas) that are based on Warcraft 3 units or models and there is no Blizzard Moba — while their community started the genre (Aeon of strife?). Then came Heroes, but now it seems only the other Mobas are staying. (No hate against Dota 2 or LoL, good games on their own.)

On the other hand it's also a little weird to just blame Blizzard for this. Blizzard still offers an awesome game, servers and balancing. Even though the fast cancellation of the pro league was hard, nobody prevents the community to grow and organize a pro league on their own. Back in the days no publisher offered pro leagues with price money. The community and third party companies created those because of the interest.

I think I'll just continue to play that awesome game and hope for the best :)"

heroesofthestorm,"I love ARAM, but it needs some tweaks.","I play mostly QP and these days aram is one of my favs. Helps me get better with all heroes and is a fun constant action way to do it. 

That said. 

The percent of games with a Chromie or Azmo is stupid. 

Since they have already shown they are of with editing ARAM, removing heroes, removing talents. Can we at least get a low odds percentage of some of the stupid high win rate heroes. 

I don’t believe their kits should be removed or altered as that would just make practicing them feel strange and limited, but it needs to be less! 

At current playing any melee hero just feels bad. 

Like ohh I have 100% health and it’s now gone.  I get ranged heroes are more powerful and that’s ok. Just lower the rate we get to pick some of the more powerful ones. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. Thoughts?"

heroesofthestorm,Icy Veins MastersClash Running League,"Starting this weekend Icy Veins MastersClash will start their running league untill ...

A home and away format will be used to have every team face off against each other twice.   
Each team will play 1 BO5 per weekend, which means there will be 4 series per weekend. 

Qualified teams are: 

30K MastersClash  
Chilly Mountain  
The Hardo's  
The Donuts  
Soundless  
Go Next  
Inting for Ruby  
ArthasStroitHram

&amp;#x200B;

For this format there will be a point system which rewards 1 point per mapwin and 1 point for winning the series. 

After the home and away format the top 3 teams will be invited to the LAN in Paris and the gauntlet will start to decide who the last and 4th team will be to come to Paris. This gauntlet is planned to be played at the 5th and 6th of June. 

Where to watch this will be covered in a later post.

heroesofthestorm,Deaths are weighted too heavily when determining MVP,"It's a silly thing really, that literally doesn't matter at all, but I like seeing people get MVP when they are really contributing. 

I see all the time where one person has highest Kills/Assists, highest hero *and* siege damage, most exp contributed... But they died 5 or 6 times so the MVP goes to the next guy, with 0 deaths because they ignored objective and solo laned the entire game. 

The award screen really doesn't mean anything anyway but it's often much more clear to the players who the real MVP was than the score screen will tell you. 

Proposed fix: Weight deaths less heavily when determining MVP. Show all 10 heroes on the award screen so I can honor the players that didn't get any specific awards but performed well."
heroesofthestorm,"I noticed that most of the Overwatch heroes' concept and creation we're taken and inspired from past Blizzard games, the leaked Overwatch skin days ago is actually genius and spot on for the hero selection.","Raynor being Soldier 76 is fucking genius because 76's kit is exactly the same how raynor plays in hots. Valla being Reaper is a no brainer and I have been dreaming for Reaper inspired skin for Valla long time ago. Reaper's trait has taken alot from Valla's gameplay in Diablo 3. Stitches being Roadhog... Well you get the point, BUT the Butcher should've had the Roadhog skin aswell so we could play as 2 different Roadhog playstyle to fool the enemy! Lastly, Johanna being Reinhardt confuses me alot and make sense. Brigitte would make a better skin choice for Johanna because of... Well the kit isn't too much different, but I get it why they chose Reinhardt instead of Brigitte for Johanna's skin, it's because both Rein and Jo has 1 projectile ability. Makes sense her E ability and taking form of Reinhardt's E from Overwatch.


No all we need is a Zenyatta skin for Kharazim..."
heroesofthestorm,I feel like I'm getting worse at the game,"Like I popped off with valeera getting 0 deaths and a lot of assists n stuff than it literally went all downhill I've been reading guides and stuff but idk

heroesofthestorm,Looking for the name (or link) of a very old video,"I remember, years ago, about when the game came out, seeing a animation video, made by asians (I think the original language was asian, but not 100% sure), where characters from heroes of the storm were fighting each others (stiches, malfurion, and others I don’t remember). We were also seeing the point of vu of a minion admiring the heroes. There was maybe 2-3 episodes but not sure about that. The animation was quite good (not drawing). I would like to see it again but can’t find it. It is so old I can’t remember more of find the right key words.

heroesofthestorm,How do you learn to play Medivh?,"I'm enjoying this hero, and even though I'm new to him, feel like I'm playing him OK. Trying to learn this hero in Quickmatch is proving very difficult.

The losing streak I am on is impressive, despite me having decent stats. I almost always have more kills than deaths, and usually finish my quest before the 10 minute mark.

The issue is waveclear, he's got the worst in the game (in my opinion) and my teammates are typical quickmatch people. Meaning no one soaks and we're always multiple levels down.

But if this is always happening to me, shouldn't it happen to the other team as well? What am I supposed to do when we're down 11 - 9 on Cursed Hollow, and the other 4 members of my team rush to the tribute while the enemy Nazeebo pushes top? 

I can't clear anything, so I should just go with my team, but without 10 it's suicide.

TL;DR - I'm not good enough, mechanically, to rack up kills with Medivh in the early game. This leads to us having a constant XP deficit compared to the other team. Is he just not a QM hero, and I should be going into Unranked Draft to learn him?"
heroesofthestorm,Aspiring Leoric player. What's your build?,"Good day community,

I am quite a new Leoric player, and I would love to hear your thoughts about the builds play.

Currently, at first I look into the team compositions, and the map. And I usually split my build into beginning and endgame:

Beginning

I usually go for the big swing and healing swing if there are 3 melee enemies to swing at. 

If I lane or double soak I go for renewal and kneel peasants.

Mid-endgame

At 10 I make a decision, if I already got healing and big swing, likely I go for triple swing ulti and try for life suck build. Because it probably is a tanky composition.

However, usually I go for entomb and auto-attack build. I highly like this one:

https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/talent-calculator/leoric#53.0!3331331

I have considered the damage reduction, but flying about after throwing on life-suck is very dependant on team follow up. 

Also, what are your thoughts about lvl 20 protected talent with my AA build?

Please share how you like to play."
heroesofthestorm,Aram Character Select,"All i play is ARAM because it's pretty mindless and ""fun"". They made ARAM a real game mode so you can complete quests which is awesome. So let's make it more fair!

Before you go any further if you're going to say ARAM is just for fun and it doesn't matter that's fine if you believe that, but is it fun to play for 10-15 minutes getting your stool pushed in (even if you have your favorite/best champ)?

If their team has the choice of a tank, our team should have the choice of a tank. If we don't pick it it's our fault, but let's at least attempt to make it an even match.

You can replace Tank with healer or AA assassin types or whatever as long as the choices are there.

My solution is simple and people might be up in arms and disagree but there are 5 roles. Let's give them all a spot.

Player 1 gets the choice of 3 healers, player 2 AA assassin, player 3 mage assassin, player 4 bruiser, player 5 tank.

On paper this seems to work. But maybe they randomize it so you can 3 mage assassin and a healer a bruiser and no tank. The possibilities are many. But if this doesn't work at least give us a fair option for a tank vs tank. Like i said earlier, if we don't pick it it is our fault.

Shut up Pokir."
heroesofthestorm,Skins S.O.S.!,"Hey Heroes,

Which heroes do you think desperately need new skins?"
heroesofthestorm,Improving Illidan,"Goals: Make him less niche and better on his own; make him easier to balance; make him cooler.

Illidan is very fun, and my most played hero (level 109). He has a lot of feel-good capabilities:

• Lifesteal/self-sustain

• Mobility

• Chase/kill potential

• Camp and boss-soloing

Plus he can split-push and make some cool plays using Evasion. He's one of the biggest Warcraft characters, with a large fanbase and two WoW expansions with him on the cover. 

But he's got issues. He needs a lot of support to shine and is hard to balance.

Crowd Control is good against anyone, but because Illidan's survivability lies in his lifesteal and in Evasion, both of which rely on attacking (because of cooldown reduction for Evasion), Illidan is perhaps countered harder by CC than any other hero in the game. 

Still, straight buffs easily push him into overpowered territory. His balance rests on a razor's edge. There's a threshold past which he becomes basically unstoppable because he heals through everything thrown at him and just keeps killing. This threshold can become problematic when a team is built around it. He needs to be less synergistic. So how do we solve this?

One idea is to increase his baseline health by several hundred but reduce his lifesteal from 30% to 15% (and Thirsting Blade down to 25%) against Heroic targets. His PvE ability would be unchanged and he could still heal up between fights, but he would have more consistent survivability during team fights while benefitting less from attack speed increases.

I'd like to hear alternate ideas, too.

Next, there's the issue of Metamorphosis. It's mainly an escape tool right now. Hardly fitting! Let's make it permanent, just like Demonic Form but still without the extra attack speed and CC reduction (that can stay for level 20 only). Just tone down the health gain and make it independent of hitting heroes.

This change would allow you to look awesome and have a bit of extra health from level 10 onward. 

Also, we could stand to buff Immolation since it does the least damage of his level 1 talents and also doesn't affect healing.

Thoughts?"
heroesofthestorm,Let D.Va use her self-destruct while dying as mech,"Title. Played D.Va a lot now and, hell, self-destruct is so bad ability to get use of, and you still can't use it to save urself duo of those timings. In fact, she can ult while dying in Overwatch, and it's really useful feature."
heroesofthestorm,"If the HOTS Team unable to put new heroes due to confusing mechanics and gameplay, I suggest they following Injustice 2's route of having ""Premier Skins"" where the characters changed their model and voice completely. Let me explain what's a ""Premier Skin"" is like...","Instead of heroes having dress-up and cosplay as your favorite characters, this premier skin concept completely changed their whole model, animation, and voice (similar to legendary skins). For example, Raynor's premier skin is Soldier 76, the entire model, voice, the animation is completely changed and you are playing AS the Soldier 76 in Raynor's kit.

For instance, you can play as Reaper using Valla's kit. This means valla's basic attack animation is replaced by reaper's shotgun, but the gameplay is unchanged and remains the same. In Overwatch's reveal trailer, Reaper has some kind of Grenade Launcher that was never shown in the game, the grenade launcher in overwatch can be used as one of Valla's multishot grenade talent (W skill) and Valla's vault (E skill) can be replaced by either Wraith from or Shadow Step.

Moving on to Johanna's skin, Brigitte could be work as her Premier skin and not Reinhardt. Both have the same weapon and a shield. Johanna's Q animation would be similar to Brigitte's shield bash, albeit with no gameplay changes and just animation change. Her W skill could anything and entirely new, Brigitte's Rally would make a good W skill as a crowd control instead of healing in Overwatch. Lastly, Johanna's E ability is exactly Brigitte's Right Click melee. Instead of pushing and stunning enemies, simply blind them like Johanna but with using the rocket flail animation instead Johanna's holy light from her shield.

So my main point is that this Skin isn't just a simple dress-up, but instead entirely giving new models, animation, and others. So you FEEL like playing as them."

heroesofthestorm,Why patch failed Valeera's Thistle Tea (+Assassinate),"A developer noticed that nobody ever used Valeera's Thistle Tea talent (level 16, refills all energy on 40s cd).  So in [the 2021-01-19 patch](https://heroespatchnotes.com/hero/valeera.html#patch2021-01-19) they cut the cooldown in half, figuring that half cooldown makes an ability about twice as good.  But instead, Thistle Tea is still useless.  Here's why:

1. **Changing a cooldown from 40s to 20s still means you get one use per fight.**  Cooldowns anywhere from 20 to 50 are practically the same, unless the ability can be used outside of a fight, like for poke, engagement attempts (like Cassia's Valkyrie), waveclear, healing, etc.   As Thistle Tea only has a purpose after Valeera has spent energy on multiple basic abilities, the lower cooldown doesn't enable using the talent more often.
2. **Energy talents are redundant.**  Besides Thistle Tea, Valeera has 3 other talents that improve energy, all at much lower level: Vigor (1), Subtlety (1), and especially Relentless Strikes (4).  An energy talent only has value if you would run out of juice without it.  If you've already got enough to keep pressing abilities, then another energy talent provides zero value.  Valeera can't afford to wait past level 4 to get energy efficiency, so there's no case where it's sensible to spend your lev16 talent on more energy.

**How to improve Thistle Tea?**

* The Thistle Tea concept is to push a button so you can do more abilities, so replace the current effect with this: **""Activate to instantly gain 50 energy and reset the cooldowns of basic abilities and Vanish.  40-60s cooldown"".**  That version gives Thistle Tea a use case for when Valeera misses a Sinister Strike or is surprisingly knocked out of stealth.

**Level 16 options**

Not only is Thistle Tea worthless, but level 16 has another talent with almost no effect, leaving Sinister Strike as the only viable option.  **Assassinate** gives a bonus when using Ambush (DQ) on a hero that's isolated from his friends.  Why is that bad?  If a hero is walking around alone after level 16, that could mean a few things:

1. He is weak, and Valeera can get a kill without needing talent help.
2. He is passively strong, and Valeera can't solo-kill regardless of the talent.
3. He has an escape button, like Genji, Murky, Falstad, Dehaka, or Dva, so the best way for Valeera to secure the kill is to take away abilities.  That means Garrote silence, so an Ambush talent is worthless.

So there's no case where Assassinate is helpful.  It's just a joke talent if you want to overkill a hero who was doomed anyway.

**How to improve Assassinate?**

1. The talent concept is to have improved threat in sneak attacks on a lonely enemy.  So remove the link to Ambush (DQ), and allow the talent to also work with Cheap Shot and Garrote openers.  
2. However, a function of Valeera finding a solo hero and killing him isn't valuable enough, because past 16 it is teamfights that really matter.  So on top of the isolated hero effect, give Assassinate a different benefit against groups: **""Using Ambush gives Valeera XXX shields for each nearby enemy hero besides the target, lasting for 3 seconds"".**"

Vol'Jin

\-------

Game starts by having the player 'Choose a Path'

&amp;#x200B;

I put a lot of effort into the Lukou, some of the stuff in healing spray might be OP to start with and may end up being talents.

	A)Lukou: Healing, beneficial buffs, healing THROUGH buff.

	\----------------------------------------------------------

		Q: Healing Spray? (I think this spell needs it's own hit box to work...): Heals for 80 at point of impact (minor regen effect? 40 over 3 seconds?), 220 in the center of the blast and 70 for the fallout. The remaining maths (whatever particles aren't physically picked up by a hero) are divided onto the map as green particles and can be collected but dissipate quickly (sort of like the XP things but they remmain in motion). Mechanics are as follows: Starts at Vol'Jin, arching outward in a ""spraying"" fashion. Think a bottle of Febreeze. Sidebar: I think this is a dope idea.

&amp;#x200B;

			Talents: Anything that increases the amount healed, length of time particles remain up, regen amount. Level 16 could be to turn it into Healing Rain where it heals not unlike tranquility in a larger-than Blizzard (talented Blizzard) AoE, but the heal is a HoT, like damage from Rain of Destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

		W: Brote Parusia (No idea how they spell it in Lord of War, ""brothers in arms"", cmon you've seen it.): Enchants all nearby friendly melee weapons with either poison (xD) that deals 25-40 damage over 4 seconds. Stacks 3 times. Lasts 12 seconds. OR Fire for +50 magic damage. Lasts 5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

			Talents: Added effect for poison could be a slow. Fire could include a burn(DoT)

&amp;#x200B;

		E: Telum Wivae Siccescendo: Enchants a friendly players weapon to leech 5% enemy health per hit. Recast to instead give player mana drain and gain 20 mana per attack and enemy loses 20. Shared cooldown. Lasts 12 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

			Talents: I'd say this one is on a high GCD so anything to reduce the GCD.

	

	B) Shango: Elemental Damage, poison, the troll uses two Kukri.

	\-------------------------------------------------------------

		Q: A Natural Surprise: Vol'Jin lunges forward with his tainted Kukri - damaging anything in a straight line for 135 - 185 and then 90 poison damage over 3 seconds.

	

			Talents: Added effect - increase movement speed after hitting enemy hero by 30% for 5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

		W: The Loa: A weak form of Shango appears on the battlefield (obviously some ai will have to be written for this but, one could probably apply the same algorithms from the Frost Elemental, just substitute different abilities, like:

			\-Spark

			\-Electrocute

			etcc....

		

			Talents: I have my doubts about this ability, still thinking about it.\\

&amp;#x200B;

		E: Poison Dart: shoots a poison dart at the enemy, dealing 86-123 damage over 6 seconds

		

			Talents: reduce DoT time, so instead of 6, could be 3. Increase overall poison.

&amp;#x200B;

	

	C) OGoun: Debuffs, strengthens the team by making others weaker. LOW GDCs, curses SHOULD NOT LAST LONG.

	\-----------------------------

		Q: Curse of Frailty: Lowers armor by 25 (AoE, area is similar to Blizzard). Lasts 5 seconds.

			

			Talents: Increase armor decrease. Added effect adds slow.

&amp;#x200B;

		W: Curse of Impotence : Lowers attack power by 50 (cone AoE). Lasts 5 seconds.

			

			Talents: Added effect - grants visibility of enemies for 6 seconds, slows attack speed by 30%

&amp;#x200B;

		E: Curse of Benight : Lowers MAGIC attack power by 60 (single target). Lasts 5 seconds.

			

			Talents: Added effect - silences target for 6 seconds

&amp;#x200B;

		Quest talent: Increase curse time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

HEROICS

\--------

&amp;#x200B;

Hex (Frog) - Turns enemy hero into a frog - until death (or dispel). Enemy hero's health is reduced by 40%, armor by 30, slows attack speed by 30%, slows movement speed by 30%. Units hit by the frog are turned into a frog for 6 seconds (AA refreshes timer).

&amp;#x200B;

Hex (Pig) - Turns enemy hero into a pig - until death (or dispel). Enemy cannot be controlled, becomes a neutral unit, and attacks at wild. Enemy hero's health is increased by 40%, armor by 20. Units hit by the pig are caused to bleed for 75-90 over 3 seconds. AA refreshes timer."
heroesofthestorm,My probius rework idea,"Probius basic ability changes-
2 charges of photon cannon
Warp rift is not 1.25 seconds long instead of 1.75
As suggested by ProbeGang, the plyon should get two charges!

Probius talent changes-
Teir 20
""Shoot em' up"" gives a passive: 10 percent of damage dealt with disruption pulse is turned into sheilds for probius.
Teir 16
All old teir 16 talents will be replaced
""Sheild battery"" cooldown of 12 seconds, lasts 11.5 seconds, gives pylons, photon cannons, and heroes 10 sheild a second!
""Warp burn"" warp rifts will now deal a additinal 6 percent of the players max hp over 6 seconds!
""Pulse shock"" disruption pulse slows enemies by 20 percent for 1 second and deals 100 more damage

Tell me what you guys think of my rework and what you would change. This was done as probius play rate is 0.8 percent and he can be counterd by almost all character, plus I just realy like the character and thinks the changes would be good.

Old Chromie for example, it was oh-so-fun to delete someone from a million range with no counterplay but thankfully it got changed since it was really not pretty being on the other end of this exchange.

One thing I've wondered about is how everyone feels about playing against Abathur who goes locust build? I know it's very fun to play this build, but when playing against it, it feels like there is no counterplay. When Abathur digs behind your fort, spawns locusts and gets out, you lose fort if you don't instantly respond, and even if you do, fort will suffer severe damage.

If you stay at home to babysit forts, Abathur can just focus on teamfighting and win the game. If you go to a teamfight, Abathur destroys your fort while their team backs out, and then joins the teamfight 15 seconds later. Even if you pick Dehaka / Falstad, the best case scenario is that you kill Abathur while your fort suffers some damage, as teams fight 4v4.

Do you consider these talents balanced and fair or would you change something?

heroesofthestorm,Recent influx of players from other MOBAs,"I have seen a ton of posts on here, Twitter, and Blizz forums about players leaving other MOBAs to play HOTS. I think this is fantastic and refreshing to see. I’m just curious though what has recently sparked this decision and influx from new players? I know for a fact it wasn’t Blizzcon! 

Was it CCL?
Was it Streamers?
Was it recent articles stating that the game is in a really good place with less Blizzard oversight?

heroesofthestorm,Average queue times?,I just tired queuing for my first Unranked draft since coming back to HotS and it took over 30 min. Is this normal? I can literally play entire matches of other games in that amount of time. I literally did watch and entire anime episode while waiting. If that is normal I may never play  anything but quick match again just because I don't have that kinda time to wait. Which is a shame cause I would like to see what the game is like with some coordination.

In Lol it shows damage just done in a red healthbar as a yellow chunk that waits a before shrinking away. For green healthbars it does the same but the chunk is red.

In HotS, it seems to be a semi-transparent yellow or something, but it's hard to make out. Sometimes it looks like the semi-transoarent color that healing has. The result is it's hard for me to get a feel for how much damage I've done a lot of the time.

heroesofthestorm,Helpful Tips Against Tilting,"&amp;#x200B;

[This mindset has been very helpful to me lately!](https://preview.redd.it/orvolamfs8j61.jpg?width=1932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a6bec2106b673c6e63ffc2f005b31e95fc96e4)

Hey Heroes,

I wanted to share with you three concepts that I learned from Developmental Days offered by the group CCS regarding tilting while playing HOTS.

First, I wanted to share a sticky note I created from one of the videos they shared.  This mindset has helped me tremendously.  I place the note near me when playing to help remind me.

The second tip is...Take a 5-minute break if you lose a match and feel emotionally triggered.  Walk away from the game, stretch, go outside...separate yourself temporarily to help you to calm down.

I also do [Box Breathing](https://quietkit.com/box-breathing/) to calm me down.

Lastly, you only control 20% of your gameplay and decisions.  80% is controlled by teammate decisions, opponents, and gaming conditions.  You can only control what you can control.  You can only control what you can control.  A great reminder for solo queuing!  This idea has been brought out before on the HOTS Reddit forum.

I hope these help you as they have helped me.  I wanted to personally thank CCS for doing tremendous work and training for the HOTS community.  If you haven't already, I HIGHLY recommend their Developmental Days when they post them on Reddit.  You will become a better player by far."

heroesofthestorm,The Complete Drafting guide for Beginner to Advanced players,"  

Drafting in this game has an absurd amount on impact. People often ask for advice related to drafting or just when to pick which heroes and as far as I´ve seen there aren´t really any extensive guides which are up to date so I´ve decided to make one of my own. I´m a high Diamond player, so ofc my advices aren´t meant to be used anywhere beyond that. My advices are mostly aimed toward players who play in group, but most of the information can be used by solo players just as well.  
 Based on how experienced are you with the game and drafting, there are multiple ways in which you can think of drafting and team comps in general. What I provide is just one of many, there are a lot more drafting strategies besides this. This guide is aimed to get you up to advanced level.  
 **Beginner team draft composition: healer, tank, bruiser**, ranged assassin (**mage**), ranged assassin (**auto attacker**)  
 This is the most basic form of draft, easy to do, easy to execute. Jack of all trades, master of none is a great way to sum up this comp and logic of drafting. You simply draft the heroes based on their assigned in-game roles. Taking hero synergies and counters into consideration helps, but while you´re learning the basics you don´t need to overfocus yourself on it. One advice I would have is to avoid bruisers with low survivability or hp pool like Malthael or Ragnaros since they need good team coordination to work, and having more frontline makes mistakes more forgiving.

 **Advanced team draft composition:** **healer, tank, offlaner, carry, flex**  
 Here you basically break down your team into two components. The fourman which is made up of the tank, healer, carry and the flex picks. And the offlaner who soaks 1 or 2 lanes alone most of the game. The four man spend most of the game roaming together, unless the size of the map makes it impossible.  
 **Tanks and healers** the same as defined by the in-game roles. ( I don´t suggest playing non traditional tanks or healer less comps unless you´re really confident about what you´re doing)  
 **Offlaner** can be any hero that can safely soak which means: having good waveclear and either a high hp pool or and escape ability which makes him hard to gank. Generally bruisers are the best offlaners, since they also provide additional frontline to your team which is in most cases highly needed. In case you don´t need the additional frontline because your flex pick provides it or whatever other reason then there are a lot more options to choose from.  
 **Carry**: Your main damage dealer hero. Any hero with high damage potential can fulfill the role. Often it is the best strategy pick heroes who further enable your carry for example Tychus needs Crowd control effects to keep enemy heroes in their range or Valla/Greymane needs burst healing to be able to go in deep. Your carry can be a melee hero as well, Deathwing with Molten Flame build is a great example.  
 **Flex**: Can be any hero from any role. The aim of your flex pick it to either greatly counter the enemy or to synergize with the rest of your picks. Beware though, teams with low wave/campclear don´t do well on macro maps. (explained more below)

**High level drafting:** Ideally it would mean to consider all picks at all points of the draft based on their strengths/weaknesses, not taking role restrictions into any consideration. That´s not fully humanly possible, but some high level coordinated teams come pretty close to it. These are not limited to but include hard to execute comps like: non traditional tanks or none at all, cheese comps, comps without heal, super macro comps. This guide ignores most of those since they are pretty much limited to high level coordinated play.

Let´s take the draft phase into two separate parts: The early **first pick/ban** period which is up to the second (red) team picking in their first two heroes, and **the latter part of draft** the which concludes the rest of the draft. The draft strategy I provide works completely different in those 2 stages:

**A) First pick/ban period.** (up to second team locking in their first two heroes) The easiest approach is knowing the first pick/ban priority heroes, and make your picks and bans accordingly. Ideally you want at least 1 of them picked for your team, then build upon it. Just picking high priority heroes to make up your team won´t mean anything if those individual heroes don´t have any synergy between them. Stats working in your favour always help, so I´d advise anyone to learn at least 1 first pick/ban priority hero from their main role. Heroes that have \* after their name are even a little more impactful, and the most contested picks overall.  This hero list is based not only on the power level of the characters, but also the difficulty of countering them – which is in early picks often a more important factor.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Universal first pick/ban priority heroes:** Healer: Stukov, Brightwing(\*-for big macro maps only),      Uther   
Tank: None   
Bruiser: Dva\*, Gazlowe   
Ranged Assassin: Cassia\*, Chromie\*, Tychus - ( more often only to deny him to the enemy!)   
Melee Assassin: None   
Support: None ( not contested enough at this mmr to warrant it ) 
2. **Map dependent first pick/ban priority heroes:** Cursed Hollow: Diablo, Hogger\*   
Tomb of the Spider Queen: Diablo, Johanna, Rexxar\*, Tassadar   
Battlefield of Eternity: Diablo, Greymane, Hanzo, Li Ming\*   
Garden of Terror: Diablo, Hogger\*   
Towers of Doom: Diablo, Hogger   
Infernal Shrines: Diablo, Hogger\*, Sonya\*, Kael´thas   
Alterac Pass: --   
Braxis Holdout: Rexxar\*, Lucio   
Dragon Shire: Hogger, Rexxar\*, Zul´jin   
Sky Temple: Abathur (vikings banned preferably)  
Volskaya Foundry: Hogger, Hanzo, Zul´jin   
Hanamura Temple: Sonya  
( This list should change over time, if there is a demand I will update it)

So how does this affect you? It´s completely different depending on whether you play as a team or you´re solo. **If you´re solo:** Then you either look at your team´s prepicks, and try ban those heroes from the list which could majorly counter them -- asking your teammates is an option since you may not know those counters yourself well enough. If that´s not an option you can try to make a squeeze for a certain role - meaning you ban the best heroes but one from the role, then try to snatch it for your team. For example you ban Gazlow + Hogger, and you pick Dva. You should do this mostly on the Ranged assassin or Bruiser role, maybe tank occasionally --- since those end up being the most impactful mostly. I would also advise you to just always ban Abathur on big macro maps unless you have a reason not to - Since in my experience having an Abathur both on your and on the enemy team makes the outcome of the match too volatile usually.

After the ban phase you look at your team´s prepicks: In case they don´t have a first pick priority hero between them, you just pick one from your role -- however never force yourself to play a hero you´re not comfortable with for this reason. If they already have a fp prio hero you preferably let them pick it - having more than 1 these heroes from the list doesn´t hurt, but keep in mind that **in most cases individual hero synergies, and countering the enemy heroes help more**.(more on that below) Additionally you can pick a hero just to deny it, but I wouldn´t recommend it unless you absolutely know what you´re doing. For example Diablo + Tychus pick.

**In case you´re drafting for/as a team:** The principle is the same, you try to ban heroes from the list, that are also strong counter into the heroes your team wants to pick first.(teamcomp descriptions below might help more with this) In case there aren´t really heroes like that and you don´t have any strategy figured out yet then you should just ban the strongest picks for the map, which you don´t want to pick for your team. Ideally you have the players with smaller hero pools pick first, so that you can stay more flexible for the latter half of the draft. Begin with securing 1-2 first pick priority heroes from the list, having more than that doesn´t hurt, but if you have no clear reason for picking it : denying it, synergizing, countering – then it´s there´s no need to focus on the listed heroes needlessly. You should also take into account not just the hero´s base strength, but also the players individual skill with the hero – weaker picks can be stronger if the player plays the hero in question at a considerably better efficiency.

**B) Latter half of the draft:** There isn´t really that much of cutting corners here, no surefire method – one way or another you´ll need to acquire a lot of knowledge and experience to consistently outdraft enemy teams. Going too much into the details isn´t really an option here, since entire books could be written about the topic and still cover only the portion of intricate hero synergies, interactions, team compositions infinite number of small details that should affect your decision-making progress.  
 The entire process can be simplified by giving team comps different attributes, depending on what they excel at, how they interact with the map mechanics and their win conditions. The upside of this method is that I can provide a lot of information in a relatively short text, the downside that the information needs to be somewhat generalized, meaning that it **won´t hold true for all situations, only for most of them.**   
 As two basic aspects every team comp has a **Teamfight and Macro** potential. Both are quite literal. Teamfight potential measures the teamcomps ability as whole to win teamfights. Macro potential measures the teamcomps ability to win the match by global pressure, objectives, splitpushing. Macro is about creating situations where your enemy can only face you under severe disadvantages. If your team doesn´t have the upper hand in either teamfight or macro potential, you´re basically at your enemies mercy, you can only win by them making misplays. What´s important to remember is that neither of these attributes are exclusive, teamcomps can be strong both at macro and teamfights at the same time.  
 Whether macro or teamfight potential is more important in a match vastly depends on the map. 

**Macro maps:** Cursed Hollow, Tomb of the Spider Queen, Garden of Terror, Sky Temple  
 **Teamfight oriented maps:** Alterac Pass, Volskaya Industry, Hanamura Temple, Battlefield of Eternity (if the enemy has a lot better objective race you need strong engages and crowd control)  
 **Even maps:** Braxis Holdout, Dragon Shire, Towers of Doom

This by no means means that you can´t win a map for example on Cursed Hollow by your teamfighting strength, these are only simple pointers to better figure out what strategies work better on which map. In lower ranks most times it´s safer to just focus on playing more teamfight-oriented comps, since they are a lot easier to execute.

Beyond those 2 main aspects there are smaller attributes that each teamcomp has. Depending on how strong the enemy teamcomp is in each attribute you should use different approaches in countering them. The most telling picks about the enemy´s teamcomp are usually it´s main damage dealers. If you´re not sure what teamcomp they´re going for it´s better to build on your own strengths and only dedicate your last 1-2 picks to countering or “answering” the enemy picks. Ideally of course you want to build up your own teamcomp´s strength while providing the enemy with a hard matchup at the same time.   
 Again, these attributes are not exclusive: a single teamcomp can be strong in more than one of them and a single hero can be strong in more than 1 attribute. The degree against which you should respond to these enemy team attributes by drafting counters depends how many and how strong heroes they draft for the attribute in question. I included a scoring system for it but it´s entirely optional, and the information provided in the description should be more than enough.  
 Attribute scoring:  
 0-1 : Doesn´t hurt to have a response, but overall can be ignored.  
 1-2: At least a slight to moderate response is needed, even more if you expect the enemy to draft more heavily into the attribute in question.  
 3+: You need to have a strong response or the enemy might acquire the upper hand in most teamfights.  
 ( Heroes with their attribute scores are listed at after the end of each category below)  
 

hard CC – stuns, silence and stasis, soft CC – slows, roots, blinds  
   
 

**Teamfighting attributes (dive, poke, burst, sustain, tankiness):**

1. **Dive:** Dive is usually easy to counter, but hard to identify in time – since most dive heroes are picked at the latter part of the draft. It thrives against squishy teams and teams without much of hard CC. To counter dive against your team you can reduce the number of their potential targets by drafting more bruisers/tanks into your team, draft heroes with heavy CC ( point and click stuns are the most effective since they reliably work even against the most mobile characters Varian Taunt or Uther stun, Brightwing polymorph, etc.) , healers which have high survivability and/or burst healing are also preferred against teams with strong dive.  
 The level of your response against teams with dive should not only depend on how many dive heroes they have, but also whether they have a tank/healer or support pick which can further strengthen them.   
 **Dive Heroes:** All Melee Assassins + Chen, Hogger, Yrel, Tracer, Genji, Thrall (1)  
 **Healers that strengthen dive:** Brightwing, Uther, Kharazim, Whitemane, Rehgar, Anduin (0.5)  
 **Tanks that strengthen dive:** Anubarak, Diablo, Tyrael, Muradin, Mei, Johanna (0.5)  
 **Other heroes that can support dive:** Abathur, Medivh, Zarya, Dehaka, Sonya (1)
2.  **Poke:** Poke is never really the most important factor to consider. For one sustain healers can deal with it way too easily, secondly it is usually really hard to utilize in a meaningful manner. It is still not a factor you can just ignore, and in the unlikely case you´re matched up against a team that´s heavily invested in it, having some answers against it can make the game easier.  
 A sustain healer is the easiest answer against poke, if that´s not an option you can draft characters with self-sustain. If the enemy team has multiple poke heroes you can shut it down either by tanks with hard engages + CC, or by dive since most poke heroes are weak to it.  
**Poke Heroes:** Azmodan, Chromie, Hanzo, Junkrat, Li Ming, Lunara, Mephisto, Sgt. Hammer, Tassadar, Zagara (1)  
There are of course more heroes which have some poke in their kit, but it´s not significant enough.
3.  **Burst(damage):** Most burst heroes are mainly mages, but there are also some basic attackers, and melee heroes that can deal considerable amounts of burst damage. Teamcomps that heavily rely on burst usually need some hard CC so that they can decisively secure kills. If the enemy team doesn´t lean heavily into burst there isn´t really any need for a response. If they do burst healers (preferably with cleanse), a tank with big hp pool and some defensive abilities (Muradin, Varian, Mei …) are great ways to deal with it. You can also draft a tankier frontline since heavy burst teams are usually overrun easily and provide more survivability for your team. In case the enemy has 2 or more ranged burst characters they are likely to be vulnerable to dive as well.  
**Burst heroes:** Jaina, Alarak, Butcher, Cassia, Chromie, Deathwing, Greymane, Hanzo, Kerrigan, Li Ming, Nova, Orphea, Qhira, Tychus, Zeratul, Kel´thuzad, Probius, Rexxar, Ragnaros, Imperius, Maiev Kael´thas, Tassadar(1)  
**Tanks that strengthen burst:** Anub´arak, Etc, Varian, Garrosh (1), Blaze, Mal´ganis, Johanna, Stitches (0.5)  
**Healers that strengthen burst:** Kharazim, Stukov, Tyrande, Uther, Ana (1), Brightwing, Deckard (0.5)  
 There are other characters that support burst heavily like Gazlowe, Leoric, Xul etc who help with their CC ultimates to further lock down targets, heal reduction or even help the team disengage after a successful burst. I choosed not to include them, because they are usually not constrained to that role thus aren´t reliable indicators of what the enemy composition is aiming to be. If you however see them drafted alongside an already burst heavy comp your response should be stronger.
4.  **Sustain(damage):** Heroes with sustain damage are far more numerous. Ranged sustain heroes usually have great survivability, yet they perform the best with a big frontline or additional support. Melee sustain heroes usually don´t have that much of a damage potential, but they provide additional utility to the team with their tankiness or CC. Nearly all teams have some amount of sustain dmg Heroes, but just like with poke only a few base their teamcomp on sustain damage heavily. In most cases heavy sustain comps deviate from the standard hero role distribution, they include a double healer or double tank or healer + support or double-triple bruiser in them coupled with a ranged hero with uncapped damage potential—hypercarry--.( this can be a burst hero even, react accordingly, Guldan, Valla, Zul´jin, Cassia – sustain, Li Ming, Tychus, Orphea, Tassadar - burst ) These comps are usually rare, so you don´t need to concern yourself with them too much.  
  If the enemy comp has a low to medium amount of sustain damage having a sustain healer helps, but it is in no ways necessary to have. If the enemy has a heavy sustain comp there are two major ways to deal with it. You can draft a burst team that shuts down 1 target decisively then disengages, or you beat them at their own game: You draft a team comp that can outsustain them. Heavy sustain comps usually have weak macro presence as well, on macro maps you can easily exploit that. Healing reduction is also great to have against them.  
**Ranged Sustain damage Heores:** Cassia, Falstad, Fenix, Gul´dan, Junkrat, Lunara, Mephisto, Nazeboo, Raynor, Sgt. Hammer, Sylvanas, Tracer, Valla, Zagara, Zuljin (1)  
**Melee Sustain damage Heroes:** Artanis, Chen, Dehaka, Dva, Gazlowe, Illidan, Leoric, Malthael, Misha, Samuro, Sonya, Thrall, Xul, Yrel (0.5)  
**Supports that go well with sustain:** Zarya, Medivh (1)  
**Any healer or tank** (0.5)
5.  **Tankiness:** Tankiness is the teamcomps ability to both provide cover for their backline coupled with the frontline´s own survival capability. How much tankiness you want depends on how vulnerable to dive your backline is, and how much burst the enemy has to threaten your frontline. It is both an offensive and defensive tool at the same time. As long as the enemy doesn´t have any counters into it it never hurts to have a more tanky frontline than them If the enemy drafts a really tanky teamcomp then your options are to counter it or match it. Note that even if you counter it you will still need tankiness to cover your backline, just not as much as them. The strongest counters into tanky teams are CC and % damage. Most tanky heroes have lower mobility than the rest of the herobase, they make up the only category against which soft CC is nearly as effective as hard CC. Drafting heroes with soft CC is nearly as effective against them as hard CC. Slowing effects don´t stack though so don´t invest too hard into it.  
 Poke and heavy sustain teams are also strong into tankiness, but they are more matchup dependent therefore harder to utilize and less reliable.  
**Extra tanky heroes:** Cho, Diablo, Mei, Muradin, Varian (1.5)  
**Tanky heroes:** Arthas, Blaze, Deathwing, Dehaka, Garrosh, Imperius, Johanna, Stitches, Yrel, Etc, Anub´arak (1)  
**Less Tanky heroes:** Artanis, Chen, Dva, Gazlowe, Leoric, Mal´ganis, Rexxar, Sonya, Tyrael, Xul (0.75)

**Macro Attributes (global presence, wave and campclear, objective securing, pushing power, rotational advantage) :**  


1.**Global presence:** Globals either allow heroes to be effectively at more than one place on the map at the same time,(vikings) or cut down travel time between two distant points of the map (Dehaka, Falstad …). Globals are one of the most painful things to deal with in Hots if played right. Heroes with good global presence usually have weaker teamfighting capabilities as a tradeoff, but fighting them head on often results in structure and soak disadvantages. Because of that drafting a team comp that beats them in teamfights isn´t hard to draft, but it can only provide a solution on teamfight oriented maps. Teamcomps with global heroes are stronger the more split are players on the map, on macro maps they require coordinated teamwork to outplay and are really hard to counter effectively. Against teams with heavy global presence you can either match it with your own global hero picks, or try to draft a teamcomp that beats them in both teamfighting and splitpushing potential. On maps with strong objectives you can also try drafting a team that excels in securing/pushing with the objective.  
**Strong Global heroes:** Vikings, Abathur (1.5)  
**Medium Global heroes:** Falstad, Dehaka, Zagara (1)  
**Weak Global heroes:** Etc, Brightwing, Deathwing, Illidan, Murky, Azmodan, Samuro, Morales (0.5)

2.**Wave and campclear:** Wave and campclear is the lifeblood of any teamcomp. It defines the speed of your rotations, your presence on the map, allows you to play more aggressively. The benefits of having good wave and campclear are great, but after a point they provide diminishing returns only. Usually 2 heroes with good wave/camp clear is plenty ( 1 in the four man 1 as an offlaner), but sometimes even having 1 is enough since there are a lot of heroes that have early talents which make up the difference easily. It is an attribute that you can´t completely forget about, yet you don´t need to overconcern yourself with it. Tomb of the Spider Queen is the map where it matters the most. On big macro maps with many camps having a hero with Bribe can also make a difference  
 I think which heroes have good camp/waveclear is pretty straightforward, I can include it if someone wants me though.

3.**Objective securing/stalling:** This attribute defines the teams ability to secure the objective on the specific maps. This means of course that each map has a different set of heroes which help secure the objective the most. Even though this category is included under the Macro play there should be extra attention paid to it **since Teamfights, Macro play and Objectives are the three major actions that lead to an enemy core falling.**   
 If your team is heavily invested into winning the objectives- having heroes that greatly enchance the whole team´s pushing power (listed in next category) helps a lot. Of course this counts only for maps on which it is possible to push with the objective. Overall macro and teamfight potential play a big part in securing the majority of objectives, less in others. If you feel like you´ll lose out on objective securing power hardly compared to the enemy team, then one of things you can do is draft heroes that defend against the objective well Ragnaros is one of the great examples for this. However I don´t really advise focusing on this too much,(unless you have a clear reason for it in mind, like stalling the game till 20 because you have heroes that scale better) since just by securing more teamfighting or overall macro power against a team comp that is focused on objective securing, you´ll find many openings against them.  
On several maps stalling the objective, while other members of the team soak/push/secure another part of the objective is a great strategy. It usually works the best if you include global heroes. The weakness of this strategy is that if the team against which it´s used has stronger global presence than the team using it, then usually the team down on global presence expends more resources, making the strategy not worth it.  
 **Maps on which this strategy can work:** Cursed Hollow, Sky Temple, Tomb of the Spider Queen, Garden of Terror, Alterac Pass, Towers of Doom.  
**Stalling heroes:** Ana, Deathwing, Tyrande, Vikings, Ragnaros, Samuro + poke heroes are capable of it too, but generally not without putting themselves into danger.  
Maps listed with the best objective securing heroes/attributes for each:  
**Alterac Pass:** The outcome is mainly decided by teamfighting potential. Global presence and stalling play some part as well, but rarely are they the deciding factor. Some poke heroes work especially well here, because the defending team is usually in a great position to poke.  
 **Hanamura Temple:** Teamfights usually play the biggest part here as well. Teams with sustained damage and healing have an easier time locking the objective most often. (One common mistake I see though is overfocusing on the objective on this map. Usually sieging with the samurai camp, or simply pushing while the enemy has heroes down accomplishes more than the objective itself.)  
 **Volskaya Foundry:** Teamfighting potential matters the most here too. The objective in the early game is quite weak too, so having push heroes ( listed below) which allow you to push outside of having the objective can help a lot too. Long range mages and heroes with big aoe ults ( Earthquake, Stay awhile and listen, Dragon Strike…) that either zone the enemy away or force them to fight under disadvantages can play a big role as well in securing the objectives and winning on this map.  
 **Towers of Doom:** The value of the objective is vastly connected to the state of the map. In securing a singular altar teamfighting teams do have the slight upper hand, but it can all be negated when multiple altars spawn or the more macro heavy team just acquires more keeps than them. You are only guaranteed to have the upper hand with this particular map objective if your draft is both stronger in macro and teamfights. Which rarely happens. The most important thing is just to play to your teamcomp´s strengths.  
 **Infernal Shrines:** Aoe spells that either zone away the enemy team or one-shot the objective “pumpkins” help in acquiring the objective the most. The best heroes for that: Dva, Tychus, Ragnaros, Deathwing, Valla, Sonya, Kael´thas, Xul  
**Battlefield of Eternity:** Having heroes that can race the objective matters the most in securing it. When you have better race it´s good to have a hero who can poke the immortal from long range as well, since the enemy will want to hard engage on your team when they´re losing the race. If the race is pretty much even the team with the better teamfighting potential locks it in in the majority of cases.   
 Best obj race heroes: Greymane, Raynor, Valla, Zul´jin  
 Best obj poke: Hanzo, Li Ming, Chromie  
 **Tomb of the Spider Queen:** Waveclear, stalling and teamfighting potential are usually the three most important factors in winning the objective for your team. Split fights happen often as well, and the team that rotates faster either because of waveclear advantage or other tools wins those fights the most --- consequently has the more gems.  
**Sky Temple:** Macro attributes greatly outvalue teamfighting both for winning this map and securing the obj. Because of the size of the map global presence is the most important attribute in winning the objectives.  
 **Dragon Shire + Braxis Holdout:** The strength of your four man, the strength of your offlaner and global presence are of most value in locking in the objective. Since ensuring that your offlaner is stronger than theirs is relatively easier than with the four man the most contested pick on this map is Rexxar since he wins all matchups here. In case Rexxar is banned you want to delay your offlaner pick as much as you can and lock in one that beats the enemy´s choice. Heroes that have or provide fast rotations provide a lot of value on these maps as well. ( Genji, Lucio, Medivh)   
 **Garden of Terror + Cursed Hollow:** For just locking in the objective teamfighting potential matters the most, but focusing on it too much is not advised since both of these maps are macro focused. Global presence and stalling can also play a part in deciding the outcome of these objectives.

4.**Pushing power:** Pushing power is your team´s ability to siege enemy structures with or without the help of an objective. Heroes that disable structures, spawn creatures to soak up turret shots or just have extremely long siege range enchance the entire team´s ability to siege by a lot.   
These heroes are **Push heroes:** Sylvanas, Azmodan, Arthas, Anub´arak, Sgt. Hammer, Probius, Gazlowe, Samuro, Zarya – Heroes that have high dps like Greymane or Raynor help considerably in sieging as well, but without the aforementioned heroes matter more since they create conditions for the entire team to push more safely and/or longer.

 A solo hero splitpushing right now in the game is not really much of a focus, in late game deaths become too punishing and traditional splitpushers like Nazeboo or Azmodan need to all-in too hard in order to destroy structures. ( It is a strategy that only works against poor opponents) Creating pressure on a lane then using your global to rotate away accomplishes a lot more. So ironically global heroes who can do it a lot safer are better suited for it than those with superior sieging.

**Splitpush Heroes:** Sylvanas, Azmodan, Xul, Nazeboo, Probius, Gazlowe + all global heroes

5.**Rotational advantage:** Rotational speed is mostly determined by the teams waveclear, but there are a few other heroes that can influence it too in different ways.  
 **Heroes that enchance rotational speed:** Medivh, Lucio  


What´s more popular is doublesoaking, by which the offlaner allows the four man to effectively spend less time rotating. Doublesoaking isn´t viable on all maps.  
 **Best Doublesoak heroes:** Xul, Yrel, Dehaka (map dependent), Malthael, Leoric, Dva, Hogger (Sonya can do it as well, little slower though)  
 **Maps where doublesoaking is possible:** Towers of Doom, Tomb of the Spider Queen, Infernal Shrines, Sky Temple, Dragon Shire, Volskaya Foundry – only on the first two maps is doublesoaking a popular strategy, on the rest 4 man rotations are usually better.  
   
 

This is it, ended up being way longer than I expected even though I still left some topics out. (which I may add later) My main aim was to provide more knowledge about drafting for those who want to learn, therefore I didn´t go into too much details about gameplay and execution. Feel free to point out any mistakes or ask about anything I left out. When I list out heroes based on their attributes I try to categorize them based on their most popular meta builds, and on how are they utilized in the majority of cases. This is why for example even though Valla has a build where she does mage levels of burst I still categorize her into sustained damage."

heroesofthestorm,Hey all of you new players to HotS what do you think of experience globes?,"For those of you who havent been playing HotS for a while, you might just think that experience globes have been a part of the game since it started. Originally, you could gather XP as long as you were relatively close (probably around 3 times the current range for xp globes now) to the minions, being in bushes included. 

What do you think about experience globes? Are they helpful to see how you get xp? Maybe you think you'd prefer the long range xp gathering because it's more convenient? 

Their main reason of adding XP globes was to make the game more new-player friendly. What do you think?"
heroesofthestorm,"Since there are loads of posts about stacks, here's how to solve it:","Have a game with a good random? *compliment them* on their good plays. invite them to party. have a few games. if u play well together, add as friend. play with them again. they invite their friends...

suddenly, you have a group to play with, and can play this *team game* as a team, instead of whining that playing alone sucks. you can give each other tips on how to play each others' heroes and expand your pool.

before you know it, your friend list is full, and you'll never have to play alone again.

it's really not hard, people. only problem: if you are a 5-stack, you have no random or matchmaker to blame for your failiure.

whisper is not only for toxic blaming after match, and don't be afraid of the invite button. worst that can happen is exactly the same as if you never pressed it in the first place. best thing that can happen is you get a friend or even a coach."

Example: If I shield a minion and an enemy minion damages the shielded minion for 40 damage it will show that I did 40 damage as physical.

Now I havent tested this really, I only notice it regularly so I dont know if it happens all the time or only in certain circumstances. I dont know if these artificial numbers are being calculated in score screen and are artificially inflating damage numbers. I dont know.  I just want to know if other people have noticed this.

[[Unrelenting Descent]] is missing the word ""mark"" after ""Brand.""

[[Brand of Solarion]] should read ""marks are"" rather than ""it is"" as ""marks"" doesn't appear elsewhere in this specific tooltip.

heroesofthestorm,The way to improve Kharazim,"I like the state of Kharazim in the game right now, but I'm obsessed with the improvements of the heroes I like and here's my vision of how to make him even better: 

Base kit: Increase auto attack damage by 5%. (Explained in lvl 1 talent tier)  

Level 1.

 * Iron Fists: Decrease the damage by 10% to compensate AA damage growth. (By increasing his AA damage Kharazim can do more damage by picking other traits) 

 * Insight: Every third Basic Attack restores 14 Mana, and decreases cooldown of basic abilities by 0.5secs. ( With the romoval of quest part of Insight Kharazim in early game can play his role of a healer, without unhealthy non-stop punching everything that exists) 

Level 4. All allies should require 2 auto attacks to be destroyed. (This way all allies will be equal) 

 * Air Ally: Place an Air Ally that reduces Heroic Ability damage nearby allied Heroes receive by 20%, that lasts 10 seconds with 45sec cooldown. (With this change Kharazim will be good at dealing with mages, and play his role of a support/healer) 

 * Spirit Ally: Cooldown should be reduced to 30 secs. (Rehgar has the same talent, that heals allies in the circle with 30 sec cooldown. What did Kharazim do to you?!) 

 * Earth Ally: Cooldown is increased to 45secs. (Earth Ally is too strong, so the cooldown should be increased a little bit) 

Level 13. All the talents except Quicksilver should be removed

 * New talent 1: Every 3rd basic attack grants Kharazim a shield that lasts for 2.5 secs, that doesn't stack. (I don't know the numbers to balance it, so it's up to you. I think it's cool talent that fits his kit of 3 auto attacks. It's better than generic talents he has got at this tier) 

 * New talent 2: Activating makes Kharazim unstoppable for 2,5 secs with 75 sec cooldown. Every 3rd basic attack decreases the cooldown of the talent by 2,5secs (I've had many situations when I could cleanse my ally with cleanse at lvl 16, but when I jump in I got stunned instead, and this talent could solve the problem, and overall I think it's better than Sixth Sense)

That's all I wanted to share with, thank you!

heroesofthestorm,The way we play AI games is tragic for beginners,"Yesterday I was playing a bot game to grind some daily quests - we've all been there: just start a youtube video on the second screen, pick some low level hero, run it down mid and don't think about it while the core falls after 5-7 minutes. Or so I thought. 

At the beginning of the match (we had the typical Morales/Nova/double mage/bruiser combo that only works against AI) I asked if we wanted to just cheese down midlane or actually play the game and the Nova player voted to go mid. We brawled for a bit and then two players left to the lanes while Nova and me (on Morales) and our constantly-oom-mage took quite a while to destroy the fort. And at this point I realized, we were actually playing with three beginners. Don't get me wrong - they weren't awful. They eventually won their lanes and I totally understand that you can die to a Garrosh bot with some high burst behind him. 

But the way we, the highlevel-Nova and me, played the game, was catastrophically wrong to a beginner. Our tactic would've never worked against human players: we never left midlane, didn't soak, played dumb builds, overstayed all match long and just relied on our superior micro to farm the bots and eventually destroy the core. 

So, how is anyone supposed to learn the game when especially the more experienced players play such bullshit? Many people here on Reddit have been annoyed by the weak bots, by the insufficient tutorials and lack of game knowledge of more casual players or at lower ranks (which according to some Reddit elitism apparently includes anyone up to low master... but that's a different topic). After the match I actually felt bad for the beginners, messaged two of them, gave some explanations and general tips. But I really feel like players should take those matches more serious.

 

**TL;DR:** 

Cheesing bot games makes new player develop wrong ideas of how to play HotS. Complaining about newer players game knowledge, lack of new players, smurfs and the QM matchmaking while playing objectively bad tactics in bot games is pretentious."

heroesofthestorm,Game full of snowflakes,"In the last couple of months, I've been banned numerous times because of my not-so-great chat experience with my random assembled teammates in qm and ranked. 

I generally get upset fast when I'm losing and I keep my temper at bay as long as people don't do stuff like ignoring the team fights or feeding all the time and I HATE people who say ""relax, it's just a qm"" or stuff like that. I don't like wasting my time like that with people who don't give a f\*\*ck whether they lose or win. If I spend several hours playing a game and keep losing and people tell me it's not important I get upset because for me it's wasted time.   


Anyways, to get to the point. Ma last ban was over a dispute with another one of my randomly acquired teammates. We had some guy playing Vala in our team that was suiciding himself over and over and got 10 deaths or more in a couple of minutes. He didn't respond to pings or pleads to stop it, so I eventually wrote to him ""Stop doing that you Arab moron"" (because his displayed name was Hasheem).  Then the other guy from the team answered saying he will report me because he is also an Arab. I replied telling him I have nothing against him being an Arab, but being a feeding moron would make me upset. Then he called me racist and gone AFK explaining to the other players in the team he is busy reporting me and gloating how he is gonna fix me a ban. I concluded our discussion by saying he confirmed himself a moron and thanked him.

I just don't understand how do people expect to be treated in this game like they are on some Victorian tea party, despite constantly being warned not to provoke someone's anger and try to participate in a team effort.  I met a bunch of great people in this from all around the world, but they are by far more overwhelmed by people who are being passive jerks who just wait for the opportunity to ban you for hurting their snowflake feelings. 

I don't expect anyone to be a master of this game, I myself am not a good player but I mostly try hard to help the team as much as I can, but I at least hope other people I'm playing with will try to cooperate with the rest of the team."
heroesofthestorm,Anduin needs some buffs,"Anduin is one of the most garbage healers in the game. The only time it’s ever worth considering anduin is in a game where your teammates are absolutely horrible with. positioning or you’re against garrosh. His healing output is trash. His root is just okay. He doesn’t do good damage.

It’s a shame because anduin is very popular among healer mains because of his fun kit. What would anduin need to make him not one of the trash healers? I think a 10-15% buff of his healing output would be a very simple bandaid fix."

Just wanted to get a feel for how people are playing HotS nowadays. I've been playing since beta, but have mostly taken a break the past couple years. I decided to give ranked a shot again today after a handful of QM games, and as I type this I've been waiting in queue for 11 minutes. Is it still even possible to play ranked? I've always felt that drafting heroes creates way more interesting and fun games, but this wait time is pretty brutal.

heroesofthestorm,Look at QM and you know why this game will never amount to anything.,"Stacks vs. no stacks. There does not have to be said anymore; it is a simple shit show.

The icing on the cake at the moment is that every hero is free to play and even more players are griefing on heroes they think they know how to play. Murky players unwilling to hit enemy heroes, TLVs feeding into Butcher, Probius players being useless and the list goes on. All the while your team looks like (and basically is) a random asortment of heroes from the matchmaker while the enemy team is a combination of good allrounders with group sizes of 3+2, 4+1 or a simple 5 stack.

Not saying that the game cannot be good, but hell no am I ever going again and feed this heap of shit my playtime, if it is not with at least two or three other players. Fuck. I am a literal salt mine right now."

heroesofthestorm,TLV - Let us talk(again),"Hey Guys.

For me as a TLV main -&gt; i dont get it why Baleog is the only viking who needs the others to get his full lvl 7 Talent.

Olaf(lvl 1) and Erik (lvl4) have their talents and doesn't need any vikings near them.

The fact that Spin to win is the best choice in this Tier isnt a lie and a surprise.

I would prefere if the **lvl 7 Talent from Baleog** gives him more Attack dmg instead of Attack speed and **the important thing is that he doesnt need any Vikings near him**. The **Range** buff is nice and should **stay**.

So this talent can match spin to win a little bit more.

heroesofthestorm,E-Sport Team Building and Questions!,"Hello and Good morning everyone from Athens!    
So we are here, in this community at Reddit, because we love this game, isn't that right? We want to save it from been demolished by it's own company, and we are the reason this game still exists, since Blizzard didn't even mention it at BlizzCon, excusing this by ""We don't wanna share and spoil this that coming up blah blah blah...""  Bull\*\*\*t! I know it and you know it too.   
Since the E-Sport channel powered by Blizzard got canceled for HotS, we have seen many attempts by small organizers in NA, trying to keep the fire light, making small tournaments and reminding people that you can still be competitive in this game.   
We have to thank these guys everyday for still get things done as far as HotS, and ofcourse we have to thank every day, all these superstars that still works as developers in this game. THANK YOU ALL GUYS!  
So, I made this post to propose something. Maybe I haven't seen it yet, but I think that there is not an online place where people can recruit other people and make teams, so they can Join ESL PLay or other small tournaments (just for the competition fun you know). So we can make a channel just for this purpose. We can make a channel where people who like competitive adrenaline, can be able to discuss and share their statistics and their availability of being part of a team and join tournaments together!   
I don't know how all these sounds to you! Share your thoughs pls (and sorry for the bad English!)"
heroesofthestorm,Mephisto Skin suggestion,It'd cool if they manage to add D2 Mephisto skin into HOTS in line with the D2 Remaster release.
heroesofthestorm,Other players acting rude,"Is it normal that people act rude or berate you in this game? I'm a new player and have been having fun, I know my micro is really awful, but there is no way at fixing that besides playing. But like every second match has people calling me trash, I should uninstall etc. The other problem is that even if I see teammates' really apparent macro mistakes like chasing somebody under tower and then randomly rotating, not even trying to clear the wave, they tell me I'm bad, so whatever I say doesn't matter. It feels like communication in this game is impossible."
heroesofthestorm,Sapphire Chromie concept,"I've recently started learning how to use PhotoShop (I have no previous experience with other, similar software, and I'm not an artist either, but it's something I'm interested in). While I'm still very much a beginner I felt confident enough to try and make a new tint for the basic skin of my favourite hero, Chromie (I know, I know, I'm a terrible person). The end result is less than stellar, I'm not 100% satisfied with it, but I'm proud of my progress. I chose a blue theme as the Blue Dragonflight is the only one that's not repped by a Chromie tint.   


Some things were really hard for me to do, like the eye color which is not what I wanted but what I settled for after working on this for hours and getting exhausted, but it's a great feeling being able to accomplish even this much after not even being able to resize images, or understanding how layers worked two weeks ago :D Anyways, I hope some of you like the idea of a Blue Dragonflight Chromie, one day the devs may even give us one.   


Cheers

**Mana Regen:** None


**Attack damage:** 32


**Attack speed:** 1.5 per second


**Movement speed:** 100%

**[W]: Frostlance**


&gt;Hagara conjures 4 icicles in a horizontal line, then sends then forward one after the other. Each icicle deals 80 Damage and reduces enemies’ movement speed by 15% for 3 seconds, stacking up to 4 times.


*Cooldown:* 5 seconds


*Mana Cost:* 80





**[E]: Frozen Tempest**


&gt;Hagara summons a tempest of ice and water around herself, gaining a shield equal to 50% of her total HP. Enemies nearby within take 55 Damage per second and gain stacks of Winterbound. Additionally, any slowing effects present have their durations paused.

*Mana Cost:* 100






**[Q]: Focused Assault**



&gt;Hagara leaps a short distance forward and attacks 4 times in quick succession.


*Cooldown:* 12 seconds

_____________________________________


**[R1] Heroic: Frostflake**


&gt;Hagara channels for 1 second, marking a targeted enemy Hero with Frostflake.

The mark lasts for 8 seconds.


*Cooldown:* 35 seconds


*Mana Cost:* 225






**[R2] Heroic: Sweeping Cold**


&gt;Hagara summons a large crystal that hovers above her. The crystal emits 4 equidistant beams of frost energy that circle around her, damaging all enemies they hit and applying Winterbound to enemy heroes. The effect lasts for 10 seconds


*Cooldown:* 50 seconds


*Mana Cost:* 180"
heroesofthestorm,What is wrong with ranked games?,"Backstory: I used to play hots and my rank was always plat3( i was bouncing beetween plat4 - plat 2). And i was playing this season too. Everything was as usual and i was at 50% , My stats were  W 43/43 L dead even, like i said just an average plat player. But then all of the sudden i started losing so often, like comically often and it wasn't just a losestreak. Now i have W 54/76 L so basically after 43/43 i went W 11/33 L which is legit 25% winrate. I mean ranking systems work well and if you have a losestreak you usually bounce back but this is just stupud, i play at 25% wr and there's nothing i can do about it. I have never expereinced anything like that in any ranking system. I dropped to gold 2 and enemies do play slightly worse but that doesn't help in any way.

 Did anyone experience something like that?

Maybe there were changes or something? Because statistically it's just absurd.

I am genuinely thinking of unistalling the game because even it's just a game i don't feel any satisfaction playing it if i can never win."

heroesofthestorm,"QM maphacking team (Replay and incomplete notes, but no footage since I'm banned)","So I was planning on making a video on an account that in my opinion was blatantly hacking, started taking notes and everything. After confronting the person and the guy just baits and says **""jajajaj jijijiji I am master this is a level 1500 smurf, if you have proof report me""** in spanish.... **now I want to record footage from the replay to do just that with NCH Suite, but I can't because I'm banned.**

*That same ""I am a master smurf"" coming from a Kelthuzad that had below 50% winrate in QM since 2016 over hundreds of games, and a level 160ish Zuljin with even lower QM winrate over even more games, and no SL on either, yet has somehow a lower account winrate in SL at plat 1, I don't know how others perceive that, but to me it doesn't add up, statistically speaking QM average player isn't plat 1, and you are more likely to find lower rank players in it, so to me there was a disconnect between 3 things, his comment, his winrates, and his rank.*

**So to cut things short, I decided to quit the game,** but before that I want to ride the wave of ""they forgot about HotS"" **and show you guys why I'm quitting.**

I'm from South America (which has its own servers in Brazil that share a ladder with NA) and people in these servers are too toxic, they use racial slurs and go unpunished, meanwhile the people who don't int and barely rage with coarse language after being baited by said racial slurs or inters are repeatedly banned. 

I've been posting in HotS forums to ask them to take action, but I believe It backfired miserably and the people Blizzard hired in the South American servers are playing favorites with their friends and are simply drunk on power. I've been playing since beta and I've always seen racists, inters, and hackers go unpunished because they are always active, even personally I've only been muted and locked out of the game recently...  that aside, in my opinion, only half the people in a conversation being banned is unnatural, specially when the side getting banned is the side that's reacting to slurs.

**So here's the best next thing** *since I can't watch the replay anymore to record footage***, I'll just produce the replay itself along with the notes that I was taking on the replay to edit into the footage, which are incomplete, but are better than nothing, and upload the replay for you guys to peruse. Mixed in with a little of what I was going to post initially.**

Lastly I raged a bit inside the replay because our healer refused to coordinate or even communicate, I'm not perfect, but like I said I've seen and experienced much worse even on streams. If it hurts anyone's sensibilities I sincerely apologize.. in fact I keep all my replays, I have 700 replays on my current SSD and still have an old HDD full of around 3K replays, not that they are of any use since Blizzard disabled the old version replays, but some of the profanities in them would disturb even HP Lovecraft, so yeah, an honest individual can only take so much exposure to racism, and toxicity.

PS: Congratulations Blizzard, you just lost an honest supporter that never ints even when angry, who's been here since Beta, and has been buying your games since Warcraft 1...

This is fine for heroes such as nova as an auto attack can easily bring you out of stealth from range and valeera who can choose to turn stealth off, however, zeratul (a melee assassin with a low heath pool and no easy way of getting out of stealth) has to 'b-step' to collect XP globes without wasting mana or getting in melee range (could be hard for a ranged matchup in lane)

heroesofthestorm,Hero Request: Tankadin,"I started WoW Classic day 1 with a Paladin, so I'm completely biased about this hero suggestion. We got Holy Pally Uther and 2h Mace Ret Pally Yrel. Since TBC is coming out, can we get Lady Liadrin to be our Sword and Board Pally? 

She can throw around

\-Greater Blessings of Kings, Wisdom, Might, Freedom and Sanctuary. 

\-Consecration for AoE damage. 

\-She can AoE Taunt with Righteous Defense. 

\-Cast Holy Shield to give her armor. 

\-She can utilize the various Pally Seals. These can be a stun (Justice), Damage (Righteousness), Attack speed (Crusader), Mana on hit (Wisdom), Healing on hit (Light)

\-She can get the sweet level 60 Pally Mount

\-One of her ultimate abilities can be the Blood Elf racial ability Arcane Torrent, which silences people and gives her mana. The other can be... I don't know. Make it Consecration. 

\-Her Trait can be Judgement, she can utilize a seal and cast Judgement to apply the effect of the seal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's definitely room for another tank in the roster. If we can't get Lady Liadrin, can we get Baal because D2 remaster is coming out."

heroesofthestorm,"TLV - Erik`s Talent ""Hardheaded Redhead"" (Devs we need you)","Hey Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

When youre going to the officially HP from blizz

[https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23609765/the-lost-vikings-and-how-we-learned-to-love-multiplayer-puzzles](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23609765/the-lost-vikings-and-how-we-learned-to-love-multiplayer-puzzles)

you can read the quote i like

""**Erik the Swift:** Erik is a slender, red-headed  powerhouse. He is the only one of the Vikings that can jump, and he can  use his **horned helm to charge at great speeds**, damaging enemies or  breaking through certain walls.""

As were already know Erik has a Talent to going in with his Head(but got removed and i dont know why).

So give him his lvl 4 Talent(Hardheaded Redhead) from back then BACK(baseline would be fair and NO it should not stun -&gt; pushing back would be cool to.

&amp;#x200B;

PLZ Devs Team do it and show your love to classic Characters too

cya and have a nice day"

heroesofthestorm,"Hello, which queues take less?","I don't care if it's ranked, aram or normal games or whatever mode. Which ones have more players and take less to find a match?"
heroesofthestorm,No guide lines in targeting mode,Is there a setting to switch the guide lines on and off?  I remember it used to appear when using either Off or On Release in quick cast settings.  I recently started playing again and the guides are no longer rendered.
heroesofthestorm,Lag issues every game. Possible game breaking bug for me.,"Not sure if this is a bug per se, but it is preventing me from being able to play the game, so it's game breaking, whatever it is. 
I was in the middle of a game of Heroes of the Storm. Suddenly my screen goes black and the game audio cuts out, but the game music continues. I wait 20 minutes to see if it goes back to normal to no avail and I'm forced to restart my computer. I reload HotS and queue up a (quick match) game. This time, I get stuck in the game loading menu (where it shows the map, the heroes, and their loading progress) again, except after about 5 minutes I am kicked back to the hero selection screen and told I lost connection, and am given the button to rejoin. I press 'rejoin' and am put into the match loading menu. After about 2 minutes of loading I am put into the match and for the next approximately 10 minutes I am stuck at a ping ranging from 200 to 4000. If the match lasts any longer, my ping goes to normal but I still have consistent frame drops and lag spikes every 20 or so seconds. 
Ultimately this issue leads to me missing the first 5-10 minutes of every match and then being stuck at 200-4000 ping for the next 10 minutes, and then consistent lag spikes for the remainder of the match. I have also noticed the hero selection menu is suddenly very laggy too. 
So far I have reinstalled the game, flushed my DNS, and deleted and reset the Variable.txt file. Nothing has worked so far. 
I have loaded up other online games such as Valorant and Age of Empires 2 and have had no issues playing those smoothly, so I know it is not a home network or CPU issue.

Help would be much appreciated as this is one of my favourites games of all time."

heroesofthestorm,How dead is HotS?,"I played League for years and years with thousands of hours in the game.  I just don't have the time to devote to staying current with it anymore.  Due to work and other commitments, I'm no longer a ""competitive"" gamer, and league's community is so laser focused on being competitive that it's kinda toxic when interacting with casuals.

I'm a casual player now I guess.  I know HotS isn't really getting any actual support these days, but just how dead is it?  Can I queue up for a quick match/non ranked game and have a hope of getting into a game in say, five minutes?  Are there dead hours?  If so, what time ranges?

Man, do I need a fun MOBA with a community that's not so focused on being perfect.  I'm all for diving into the mechanics and getting good enough that I'm not a burden to the team, but I'm tired of getting yelled at for missing a last hit on a minion or _just_ missing a skill shot or not using the current meta builds."
heroesofthestorm,"Hey guys, draft me for CCL!","Hello hots community! I believe I am of adequate skill to join CCL and would like to inspire you all! Last season we saw many diamond players do quite well in CCL, even if their teams got near last place. As someone who finally hit 32 point Master for 3 hours yesterday, I can safely say I am qualified to join a team. 

As we all know, CCL and hots competitive is VERY accessible  to new competitive players! Even though many diamond players got drafted over 8k+ players who are dominating SL, this is because those diamond players are actually more skilled! It has nothing to do with nepotism! 

With that, I believe I am very qualified to be drafted. I am a lili/genji main and I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to hit creeps! That’s for scrubs! 

Anyway, please draft me over these shit tier grandmasters!"

heroesofthestorm,HotS Animation Ideas,"Greeting HotS family!

In this pandemic, I have been blessed with a good paying job and working from the comfort of my home. But I have a problem.

After work, I don’t have many hobbies besides working out and cooking fun foods for dinner. So I am looking to get into art and animation. Since I have about 6 hours of free time after work each day, I thought to pick up art and learn.

Since I love playing hots so much, I wanted to give back to the community and create something. So I want to get into animation and create some of the most unique and awesome hots animation this sub has ever seen.

I know this journey will take awhile to take off since I’m a total noob, but I wanted to ask the community about ideas. 

Which of your favorite heroes/mashups would you like to see? What would they be doing? Fighting? Eating at a picnic, Netflix and chilling? (The non sexual one) or going on an adventure together? Is there a certain art style you like? Anime, cartoon, realistic, or other styles you’d like to see? Are there certain skin/outfit ideas that you’d wanted in the nexus but never got the chance for the devs to make? Mounts? This is all up in air and the possibilities are limitless! 

I would very much appreciate your feedback! I may even start a YouTube or twitch account for the art and would love to see your feedback as I’m going along. Looking forward to hearing from you and I hope to see you all in the nexus!"
heroesofthestorm,"A ramble about why I think we'll get a content drop at, or a fast follow post Blizzcon.","First off, for the ""HotS is dead"" crowd - Blizzard still staffs a lot of people making US $80K+, plus benefits, plus server hosting for a ""dead"" game. Team 1 is disbanded but like many HotS staff mentioned, they are not affected. Sure, HotS doesn't have the biggest engineering team at Blizzard anymore, but as somebody that works in the software industry, they have a sized, capable team. If HotS was dead, you don't pay salaries for something you've abandoned, you move those engineers elsewhere. Fuck Blizzard for disbanding Team 1, but still.

Similar to how the D3 awards for the virtual ticket have not been awarded yet, I am cautiously optimistic that we'll see Lilith for a D4 tie in, or a classic D2 foe for the resurrected tie in. At least, I hope Activisions marketing as a whole is still smart enough to do cross-game tie ins. At a minimum we might see a diablo character rework.

While it's been disappointing to not have a winter event (I have a ton of edged heroes) given the global scale of Covid, sending everyone home, etc, I understand it more than most. I guarantee timelines got shifted dramatically, and something many don't consider - if your entire team has time off but no reason to use it, I guarantee Blizzard had an enormous amount of people off for most of December. I don't know if this is the case, but I suspect it is, and if I had to choose, I'd say let's push off content until Blizzcon, most of my team is going to be out, are burned out, and could use a rest period. I know for a fact that an enormous amount of companies in the software industry did soft pauses for most of December.

I am very excited for DreamHaven, Frost Giant and a post-Activision world, but until then, comparative to the massacre of Warcraft 3: Refunded or SC2 going into balance patch maintenance, HotS is still very fun to play, has active development, and we were spoiled initially by a ridiculously fast initial launch content wise, so it's understandable why some view a slowdown as a negative thing."
